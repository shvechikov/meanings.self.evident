1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:37,500
Speaker 1: well hello dear audience of my channel today i have a privilege of presenting you a very special guest guest his name is jordan hall and about all of the guests who were at my channel he might be the one the most difficult to be put in the box that's why i would rather ask you jordan to present yourself to my audience who don't who doesn't know you yet but i'm absolutely confident will be excited to learn about

2
00:00:37,640 --> 00:02:24,300
Speaker 0: great um maybe three three aspects so a big portion of my life in the earlier period of my life in particular was as a technology entrepreneur in the classic silicon valley mold so i built a series of tech companies in the beginning of the internet age took them public and retired from that in 2007 when i was 36 years old i guess i have continued to participate in that world but more as an investor or board member as advisor but i have some cycles where i'll pulse into it meaningfully and then pulse away then the the second chunk which was maybe 2009 to 2022 was a world of being a highly undisciplined largely self-taught polymath with an orientation towards the big questions in fact that we'll talk about today things like the metacrisis the nature of civilization the relationship between technology and culture and things like that where i i met a large number of really interesting people and learned a lot of interesting things and then the third aspect which i would say is also very important to me is that i i was baptized and become a i would hope to say at least deeply committed and meaningfully disciplined though not well disciplined uh christian in october of not this most recent october but the year before that so quite brief and this has been a significant piece as you might imagine um largely consuming piece of my life uh for that period of time

3
00:02:27,920 --> 00:03:07,740
Speaker 1: done it better for sure uh i guess yeah let's just jump into this big topics you already brought it up uh i personally find your idea of meta crisis uh maybe being one of the most elegant eloquent ways of describing just the current state of not just the western civilization but i would say the capital c civilization and could you help me and my audience understand them better so what is meta crisis how it's different from all of the other things we've experienced before and maybe why now

4
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 0: okay so i'll start i'll kind of walk up slowly um the first thing is just maybe just to notice the idea of what is a crisis and this is from the greek sense of uh something that cannot continue as what it is so there is some usually a process or a state of affairs where there's something about the nature of that state of affairs and the nature of the context of what's happening where a a qualitative change is going to occur uh pregnancy is a crisis there's a period where birth will happen and that is a transition where the woman is no longer carrying the baby inside she is now nursing the baby outside so crisis

5
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,560
Speaker 1: uh

6
00:03:49,540 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 0: and then what we've noticed in the world now is that there are crises happening all over the place and some have come to call this the poly crisis or the multiplicity of crises and you can look sort of under any rock you'd like to there's crises in finance and economics there's crises in um birth rates there's meaning crises and psychological crises there's political crises there's ecological crises there's all sorts right all over the place and some of these are in fact uh blue overblown but many of them are under

7
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 1: order reported

8
00:04:24,200 --> 00:06:39,940
Speaker 0: and they're all happening and in some sense are continuing to proceed now the next move you can make is noticing that these crises are almost never independent so for example we witnessed that the uh the real estate crisis in the united states in 2007 spilled over into a series of financial crises around the world but those also spilled over into political crises or spilled over into even coordination crises that caused the covid crisis to become worse because the political crisis that had preceded it reduced our ability to respond to our environment right so you now have one level up and then one level above that is where we begin to talk about the meta crisis which is to say are there are there deep things things that are closer to the root that are themselves the profound foundations that are shaking right so to use the visual metaphor if we're all sort of standing on a platform and we notice that everything on the platform is shaking we might say hey everything on the platform is shaking all of these things are under crisis or we might wonder wait a minute are we standing on a platform that's on a pillar and the pillar is what's shaking in which case we need to be looking down and that was the the work that i and a number of people underwent from about again 2010 to 2017. and the answer as it turns out was something like yes there's a relatively compact set not one single point but relatively compact set of deep events that are occurring now uh that many of which are actually predictable like you could say given a proper theory or set of theories about the nature of say civilization what might we expect to occur and that these are producing the poly crisis events that we're seeing and one of the consequences of that as you might imagine is that um if you try to address the set of problems at the poly crisis level at best you're playing whack-a-mole an important fact you're usually making things worse than you're making things worse than you're making things worse because a solution that will be maybe affecting a subset generally produces spillover effects into areas that you're not paying attention to um so can you if you want to grasp this at all you have to find some way of grasping it at the most foundational level so metacrisis how's that

9
00:06:40,960 --> 00:08:37,340
Speaker 1: that sounds great and it brings me one question and one comment i will start with a short comment concerning the idea of crisis the idea of crisis is something which cannot be none of the supports of time the cannot possibly not be for СкInchiu but also i think there is an important element of revelation in any crisis crisis as a process always reveals something and in that sense i just think it kind of strengthens your arguments that we are in a process when many things which we took for granted are not for granted anymore it reveals maybe that we are not we think we are or like we don't function based on the principles we say we are our flow isenn we can't not think happening anymore more precisely we are functioning and this kind of constructive revelatory element of pain or suffering or destruction which is usually associated with crisis i also think is happening right here right now in a way it reminds of this uh deuteronomy like when it says that crisis effectively you can say that crisis is a moment of choice it's like if you remember that there is a verse uh i have said before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both of you and your descendants may leave and you can say that every crisis on a different level presents the same choice you can choose life you can choose this and that's why i think it's important exactly to talk about it right now when we live in a moment where i still witness for the last let's say three years more focusing closely exactly this welcome all game i think it's a very beautiful metaphor so attempts to trying to put a new vine into the old into the old sack so you can use it to be comparable but my question would be very straightforward so what is the pillar you mentioned that uh like everything is shaking platform is shaking and maybe it's the pillar which is shaking so what do you define as a pillar so what do you what do you think is shaking

10
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,559
Speaker 0: so

11
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,059
Speaker 1: there's what was revealed to you so sorry yes

12
00:08:42,140 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 0: yes i love this yeah what is revealed um and by the way i agree i think all the points you added there are very good so yes let me see okay so this there's three things that are at least somewhat independent one is that the as it turns out civilizations have cycles and there's lots of people who've written about them in different ways but the bottom line is civilizations have cycles and our civilization i'm going to put uh that in quotes for the moment because we'll need to dig into what i am pointing to there but our civilization is nearing the end of its natural arc so it is sort of past senescence oh sorry past maturity and is in senescence or in fact i would argue is actually undead second and not not directly connected but deeply related is that oftentimes um civilizations produce changes in the world which changes are beyond the capacity of that kind of civilization to address okay um and so for for as a simple example i mean there's many many examples but as a simple example we might say the the state of the world world's capacity to perceive and activate peace in 1945 was not equal to the novel capacity to destroy the world in the context of nuclear war and so that civilization which was sort of the holdover of the victorian british empire had to innovate an entirely new capacity to respond to this new possibility like there's no such possibility prior to then so civilizations sort of went away went their way without having to deal with it this new possibility was something that could not have been addressed at that point and so the category of the international

13
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Speaker 1: order

14
00:10:44,100 --> 00:14:40,940
Speaker 0: or the global order had to be produced in some fashion which we saw to be able to address it at all and by the way sort of nip and tuck right it wasn't wasn't obvious that it was going to make it through it's still not obvious and this happens all over the place so some classic examples are for example just population if a civilization is very successful the population grows but the population's growth produces a wide variety of different consequences and very complex consequences which at some point will outstrip the civilization's ability to continue to maintain itself it's a cybernetic auto poetic feedback loops the third which is and now we're going to start getting into the things that are unique in our current environment the third is this weird thing about the recursive uh self-building element of technology in the the famous uh curve the exponential curve which in the west we call uh kurzweil i know there's a russian who did it first and better so i can't remember his name right now but i i think his stuff is better but um there does seem to be something like that but there's something about and then i think the reason is actually pretty straightforward which is it's very very difficult to innovate some new idea it's difficult to invent calculus it's difficult to invent arithmetic it's difficult to invent the laser but once it's been invented it's relatively easy to learn how to do it again so it moves from the state of hard innovation into a new baseline once it's a new baseline new capabilities can get built on top of that and this creates a laddering effect which produces an exponential growth and so while it is the case that these new technologies are part of the second category the fact that we are now caught in what seems quite clearly to be an accelerating rate of change is novel and if that acceleration is happening inside the adaptive frame that humans are are able to uh deal with um let me think yeah let me just give you a bit of a frame here just as an example of something that's useful so i'm going to be dropping in some of the civilization theory that we produced over the this 15 year time frame if you're living in a world where the world that you live in i mean this largely the physical and technical world that you live in is effectively equivalent to the one that your great great grandfather lived in then a number of things follow the first is you won't typically have any sense or any idea of progress you'll typically live in a world that has a basic circular metaphysics seasons change days cycle people are born and die but in some sense that death is is going to be reconnected to a rebirth several generations that's something like that and there will be no need and in point of fact no capacity to imagine your culture changing your culture is well suited to the world that you're in for a long enough period of time that the only thing that matters is is in fact that you're able to maintain it and that you're made able to prevent it from changing and that's the key but as if if something happens where there is a rate of change that begins to bring it such that within that two or three generation span your world is different enough from your great grandfather's world that it's noticeable and there has had to have been some changes to the nature of how human beings view their world view their role in their world and respond to the world that they live in in order to simplify the world that they live in in order to simplify the world that they live in in order to simplify the world that they live in in order to simplify the world that they live in in order to respond to the real changes that have occurred then you're in a different kind of of world first of all there will be something like an arrow to time something like that first it'll maybe look like long circles but at some point it'll begin to flatten there's some sense of hold on we're going in a direction it's not quite clear what's happening um and you will begin to have culture will begin to have more going on at the software level let's say meaning that it will be

15
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,500
Speaker 1: more

16
00:14:41,920 --> 00:15:07,080
Speaker 0: programmable it'll be more of a sense of methodologies like the birth of law like a like the homerobby's code having to actually have a sense that we're going to formally articulate the rules which implies by the way that we can also edit or modify those rules whereas prior to that why would you formally articulate it they're self-evident and woven into the fabric of reality so deeply that what would you even mean that'd be like trying to formally articulate that when you drop a ball it falls that's a silly thing to do

17
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:43,040
Speaker 1: and just to point out you have a conflict immediately between these two set of laws the laws which are self-evident and the laws which are written uh already known to Greeks if you read Antigone the famous tragedy of Antigone like exactly two set of laws there are laws which are given by gods and there are laws which are given by this king and which law do I choose like very classical problem emerges immediately once you have this disruption and you can even say alienation from like certain self-evident bless aura and now we are dealing with on a completely different scale but go on sorry just

18
00:15:43,360 --> 00:16:29,920
Speaker 0: no this is perfect and so as you move forward with the magnitude of change and the the rate of change starts to pull in such that your life is meaningfully different than your father's life right so this happened in the industrial transition in particular in the 20th century where your life is very different from your father's life who's actually was very different from his father's life so we're now actually getting intergenerational like what they call the generation gap yes whole chunks of culture are now subject to a and necessary and B and palatable transformation but we have no methodology to actually hold that within any construct where that transformation is going to be um how do you say less than random like orderly we're doing our best

19
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,780
Speaker 1: but who knows

20
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:47,340
Speaker 0: right who knows what's going to work you throw the birth control pill into the middle of an entire species that has been grounded on the fundamental iron laws of reproduction since the beginning of the species and things are going to go weird just weird uh at best weird right hard to predict

21
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,480
Speaker 1: and social networks uh effect kind of similar comes to mind like

22
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:31,900
Speaker 0: yep absolutely or just this is called the digital as a big big stone in the pond and then of course as we move into the digital one of the things we see is now the rate of change is fast enough and big enough that even inside a single human being's developmental life like the world I live in now is quite meaningfully different from the world that I grew up in in ways that are palpable and so what this does is this creates has impacts on psychology kind of mind that can form and adapt and respond to the world that it's in actually has to be a different kind of mind now you have to be uh a mind to the that middle period where cultures would maybe say two or three generations and would drift this is a

23
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,580
Speaker 1: paradigmatic

24
00:17:32,660 --> 00:18:35,620
Speaker 0: world this is the world where we can build large-scale cultural models that sort of look like pseudo reality by the third generation but by the fourth or fifth generation they're beginning to break we have to have some process of modifying and transitioning which of course means things like giant educational institutions which can codify professionalize and regularly download paradigms on minds and convert human beings into things that can run paradigms effectively and become part of a paradigmatic machine but as you move into the 21st century the rate and magnitude changes too fast for that entire architecture and so we have to move into some novel moment so that's one big gigantic chunk but that's okay that's a novel moment we're actually in a point that is completely different qualitatively in the nature of what kind of human mind is necessary and capable of responding to the world that we're actually living in and living in more and more and what kind of cultural fabric is able to respond and and connect with that month that's an entirely new problem that we're

25
00:18:36,340 --> 00:19:32,960
Speaker 1: in right now well it is fascinating and I don't even know where to start truth be told reacting one thing which definitely comes to mind is the whole technology element which you mentioned and uh I think what we have to I think what is question nowadays and I think it's a little bit what you just talked around is like we cannot no longer go on with the idea of neutrality of the progress or neutrality of technology because that was exactly the technological optimism of the effectively enlightenment effectively enlightenment that technology is the good in itself progress is good in itself and any direction towards forward is good not nothing problematic let's say can really come off of it or if it's a over this problematic it's just due to the backwards mentality or like you know usually it was against church but in the 18th century but the general idea was just like you know people with backwards

26
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,280
Speaker 0: thinking

27
00:19:33,960 --> 00:20:02,300
Speaker 1: nowadays basically due to the acceleration and speed it's clear that without direction it's just we are entering into the overload and I think overload is a very powerful metaphor on many different levels starting from an individual life who's too much change it doesn't make sense and we see this gigantic decline into effectively medical medicalization of human existence like I can deal with the amount of changing chaos around me there is no

28
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:02,740
Speaker 0: order

29
00:20:03,340 --> 00:21:53,960
Speaker 1: I can't control this chaos so I will effectively numb my feelings numb my perceptions numb my reason and it's interesting that in fact it was kind of predicted by Huxley 50 years ago so you can effectively see and the trend was already there and I think that's something very future you have to deal with but then also I didn't plan to talk about it but I think when you brought this difference between cyclical and effectively linear it really parallels with the Greeks Greek understanding of time and they have cyclos and they have chronos so cyclical time and chronological time but it wasn't just but it wasn't that I thought there was an important third element Kairos erotic moment if you I know you know what I mean but like so like effectively to understand simply Kairos it's the perspective of eternity like or like eternity comes into this linear fashion so it's not change for the sake of change it's effectively as a popular song of the 90s look at your look at your life from the heaven size and that's what I think can be one unifying element which on the one hand is new to our current state of civilization because we are living in a very weird time which we thought we can and I do speak with because I think it's even though it originated in the West it kind of became a global phenomenon like you can say that West invented it but that this invention was accepted globally and that's why I and that's where I think this crisis reveals in not the need but absolute necessity of rediscovering like rediscovering the perspective of Eternal to deal with the changes chronological because otherwise it's impossible to keep anything sick like anything around you so that's yeah

30
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:46,500
Speaker 0: let's let's hold that get back to that because I think that's going to be a critical like scenic one on um but I want to load one more thing on before we go there so because you made a point and I think it's it's I think useful maybe even necessary to hammer that point home which is that the we is everybody um and and this goes actually to something that I haven't mentioned yet which is that civilizations as I said civilizations have cycles or dynamics um but there's a really interesting discovery that came out of the uh the study of technology technology curves um in the 70s and largely in the 90s and then recently and it looks like this so if I look at the Moore's law you know more computation

31
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,100
Speaker 1: yeah I know but just yeah I'll

32
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:58,240
Speaker 0: say it so so one of the guys who was fundamental in the innovation of the general purpose computer the this Intel one of the founders of Intel

33
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,300
Speaker 1: noticed

34
00:22:59,460 --> 00:26:41,480
Speaker 0: that computation seemed to be doubling every two years or so just to make the math easy um and by the way that has largely held so this is a long time for something which is a exponential a doubling period at the same period to hold but here's an important uh insight that most people don't pay attention to and that is the underlying physical mechanism whereby computation was done has not itself stayed static so if I if I go back into the past the earliest days of computers computation was done by means of vacuum tubes and for a little while there was a doubling of computation by means of vacuum tubes but there was a point where that just wasn't going to continue and so what happened was the the transistor appears and then there was a doubling of of computation by means of the transistor and then we've done a series of technical shifts in either the methodology of transistors or et cetera we move from the CPU to the GPU there's a bunch of stuff that's happened if you look at it what you then see is you see this really interesting effect where you'll have what looks like an s-curve technology tends to proceed by s-curves where in the beginning it's immature not well understood a lot of ancillary engineering and scientific techniques haven't been either discovered or formalized um necessary components in the economy have been put together so it's it's sort of proceeding along usually quite amateurishly or fail in a failing fashion but then it reaches a point of maturity which is the nape of the curve at that point it begins to accelerate until it achieves effectually was called mainstream it becomes the thing think about like cars right early out of it automobiles were called what do you call it uh automatic horses or something like that they were they were a niche thing at a certain point though we had gasoline stations we had rubber tires we had enough roads that it became like all the pieces fit together automobiles become a mature technology and they accelerate up and then there's a point where that actually becomes uh it enters into old age it becomes less and less relevant and oftentimes it'll actually just die so if you take a look at say for example horse and buggy went through an s-curve when the automobile came along the horse and buggy died okay same thing happened with say the rolling out of vacuum tubes and then certain kinds of transitions you see these s-curves what you see with Moore's law is you have these nested s-curves meaning just as the vacuum tube is reaching its old age the transistor comes along with a more capable possibility towards the more abstract version of things known as Moore's law or computation substrate independent okay now here's the reason why I bring that up the same thing is true of civilization there's a substrate version of civilization let's go with like Babylon Babylon has its s-curve it rises it falls but there's something bigger going on where the the the baton of civilization itself gets handed down Rome collapses the medieval period arises right things just move uh and and that's actually there's something like a progress or an increasing of certain characteristic aspects of civilization even though we had a loss of a lot of things in the context of Rome eventually it was caught up across all material factors eventually um and a lot of other things were done relatively quickly uh post to follow bro this has two points that I just want to make one is falling or death has in fact always been woven into the fabric of how we navigate the dynamics of civilization civilizations rise and fall the fall clears out a lot of stuff a collapse makes new possibility you know so the classic this is now a birth death cycle dynamic

35
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaker 1: flood washes away the old

36
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,940
Speaker 0: the flood washes it away yeah

37
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,600
Speaker 1: yeah

38
00:26:49,300 --> 00:27:41,880
Speaker 0: but then the other piece which is this we have never once in the human history had a situation where the whole world was entrained so deeply into civilization fabric and we are now in fact while there is a Chinese civilization that is in the process of bursting forth from late 20th century neoliberalism and by the way a Russian civilization is bursting forth and an Indian civilization is bursting forth which are all actually real independent civilization structures there is something about what happened in the late 20th century in the early 21st where everything became entangled in such a deep way that the collapse of that civilization structure and this is I'm gonna hit two tones one is in fact again unique in human history the magnitude scope and scale of this collapse is like say the bronze age collapse that covers the whole world

39
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,160
Speaker 1: just wanted to bring it up

40
00:27:45,040 --> 00:28:31,740
Speaker 0: yeah the bronze age collapse is the best one of the better mappings and the height from which we will fall there's the height of that platform is wildly unique and we're so much further away from a substrate level of human endeavor than ever before that a fall of any anything vaguely like a bronze age level fall or roman collapse level fall is we don't have any model for what that would look like you know that most people who try to look at it relatively closely somewhat systematically have said that there's really no recovery like we just fall to 100 million people as just pieces just continue to break particularly given how people tend to behave when big collapses tend to occur but all right so here's the last piece and then we can really move but here's my proposition i am i'm reasonably convinced

41
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,440
Speaker 1: call it like

42
00:28:32,460 --> 00:29:05,000
Speaker 0: 90 confident that we're no longer actually even just dealing with a given s-curve but with the mother of all s-curves of civilization itself civilization itself has been on an s-curve since the upper paleolithic or you know the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the or the agricultural revolution picking your poison and it has been maintaining over a long haul through a variety of different substrates its own movement and we're not reaching the end of a given civilization but rather we're reaching the end of civilization itself as a form

43
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:44,340
Speaker 1: okay then just straightforward well let's let's dive into it because i think you have to explain now what do you mean by civilization why it's coming down this curve and i want to quote you from 2023 you wrote we are now for the first time of history at a moment where the core driver of civilization break it's the city beginning to break down i would love you to answer them or highlight two questions so why the city is the core driver of civilization what is so important about the city and why is this breaking down

44
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,600
Speaker 0: all right so i i'm going to assume now that you know your audience because this is we're going deep which is great

45
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,660
Speaker 1: i love it very we're going to yeah we're going to

46
00:29:55,660 --> 00:32:56,980
Speaker 0: okay so and here i'll also specifically call out like hashtag all kings north because he's recently been doing some really really good stuff about the tension a deep tension i think he's correct a deep tension between the notion of christian and the notion of civilization which i'm going to hopefully enrich that thinking and most recently the notion of western civilization and christian okay so what do i mean by civilization there's a lot of stuff on the outside but i'm actually just going to focus on the piece that you put right in the center which is this nature of the city here's the thesis um it it turns out it has in fact been it discovered empirically that cities behave differently than the natural phenomena so if you take a look at the way that natural phenomena look there's roughly two classes there are natural phenomena that are governed by the laws of thermodynamics like uh sands from an hourglass or the freezing of water and it's largely the dissipation of energy against some particular gradient or stochastic just chance you know a couple different basic curves um the cool the way that magma cools and forms granite this is that kind of regime the second regime is large the regime of life and the regime of life actually has a very different set of curves to it it behaves differently if we look at say for example the the relationship between uh the the mass of an organism which which roughly represents the amount of matter that is in the organism and the metabolism of the organism which represents the amount of energy process throughput that the organism uses um there is a uh an asymptotic curve right as as you double the mass of an animal you don't double the amount of metabolism you actually increase the amount of metabolism by 85 so there's a it becomes more efficient over time for example um there are limits to it most of those limits are driven by gravity and the ability for large organisms to live but um it's it holds across a wide variety of different kinds of organisms it holds for cells it holds for rodents it holds for lizards it holds by the way for trees it holds for forests it's a profound thing it even holds an interesting enough for companies groups of huge organizations to live because restaurants and businesses andабот contributed because we need these customer sicher on how are we shaping how on are we greatly improving ourselves along with other communities further where we're not so Filip Courtney she knows it tool Sim Vega ukranian science and science and science umlaugh yeah okay the other hand i wanted to raise another issue um that is to say you can επιm latent why live in other what sort of environments live in in there no matter what they do or where you live in perhaps it's up or put away in their rooms or you get a place to stay away or you don't live in other places why all these about people coming in are really the scandal of things that will affect your��vitata species in general what i'd like to say is yes i think that it's it's a partecipation to building at least majority of these things and although we feel it the way it does if you double the population of the city, you increase a set of metrics, not all, but a set of metrics by 115%.

47
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,000
Speaker 0: So you get increasing returns to scale.

48
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,180
Speaker 0: Most notably, you get wealth per capita and innovation per capita.

49
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,300
Speaker 0: It's increasing faster than the rate of doubling of the per capita.

50
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:32,000
Speaker 0: So if I take a city and I go from like a thousand person, very small town, and I double the 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 16,000, you're getting to the point where a person who's living in, let's say, a hundred thousand person city, the average person will tend to make something like three times as much and produce three times as much innovation as exactly the same person in the smaller city.

51
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,080
Speaker 0: And it seems to be entirely driven by the fact that they're in the city.

52
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Speaker 0: Okay.

53
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,840
Speaker 0: Now this is empirical.

54
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Speaker 0: What I'm about to add next is my own thesis.

55
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,860
Speaker 0: And we'll see.

56
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,500
Speaker 0: This is the thesis I'm proposing.

57
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,060
Speaker 0: Basically, the idea is that there's something going on in the way that minds are able to collaborate.

58
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:03,780
Speaker 0: Something going on in the, say, the transcendent that is different than what happens at the level of the physical or, let's say, even the eminent, the embodied.

59
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,699
Speaker 0: And that when minds enter into relationship with other minds, they are able to produce innovation.

60
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,860
Speaker 0: They're able to produce wealth.

61
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,780
Speaker 0: They're able to produce new insights on this basis of this evidence.

62
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,800
Speaker 0: And so that's the idea of exponential growth.

63
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,040
Speaker 0: This period doubling increases by 15%.

64
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,540
Speaker 0: Now that's an incredibly powerful engine.

65
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,020
Speaker 0: It's novel in the world, right?

66
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,199
Speaker 0: It's nothing else in the world seems to behave like that.

67
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,159
Speaker 0: And that's a high leveler.

68
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,260
Speaker 0: It leverages heavily.

69
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:43,360
Speaker 0: Left to its own devices, the logic of that is that eventually all bodies, all human bodies would congregate into a single giant city.

70
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,300
Speaker 0: But here's the rub.

71
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:46,679
Speaker 0: We're bodies.

72
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,639
Speaker 0: Our bodies are constrained by things like, how do we get access to food?

73
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,659
Speaker 0: How do we get access to air?

74
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,920
Speaker 0: How do we get access to sunlight?

75
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,420
Speaker 0: How do we get access to the way to move waste out of the city or the location that we're in?

76
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:57,540
Speaker 0: Space.

77
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,240
Speaker 1: That was an important element.

78
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:00,740
Speaker 1: Space.

79
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,960
Speaker 0: Space, yeah, exactly.

80
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,960
Speaker 0: We are physically embodied in space and, by the way, in time.

81
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:13,060
Speaker 0: And so we are constrained by the nature and the mineral world of the previous two regimes as we're endeavoring to do this.

82
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:29,300
Speaker 0: So the problematic of civilization, has been when humans became entrained to the potency of this collaborative power within the context of the constraints of their ability to actually concentrate people in collaboration.

83
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,320
Speaker 0: And so you take a look at a given city, let's go Rome, because that's the one I spent the most time on.

84
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,780
Speaker 0: If you look at it, you see three things that are very interesting.

85
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:45,040
Speaker 0: One is everything is converted into territory to serve the needs of Rome.

86
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 0: So that the hinterlands are no longer wilderness, they are farms, because they have to be functionally food to move into the center.

87
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,860
Speaker 0: Or they're water, or they're minerals, right?

88
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,340
Speaker 0: They're material that are functional.

89
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,780
Speaker 0: They are converted into functional on the basis of the center.

90
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:15,460
Speaker 0: Second, while you have many cities, there is, in fact, a very typical most significant city at the top of the pyramid, and then a cluster of two to three cities that are below it that are roughly half its size.

91
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,620
Speaker 0: Then a cluster of 16 that are below them that are roughly half their size, and they tend to be more specialized.

92
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,900
Speaker 0: And so in the United States, Chicago is kind of like a mercantile logistics hub.

93
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,140
Speaker 0: Los Angeles is an entertainment hub.

94
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,660
Speaker 0: New York is the capital.

95
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,520
Speaker 0: Now, we move the political capital, but that doesn't really matter.

96
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,100
Speaker 0: Typically, typically.

97
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,180
Speaker 0: Not universally, but typically.

98
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Speaker 0: And then the next thing is that this continues as long as it can continue, right?

99
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,380
Speaker 0: So you basically have a gambit.

100
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,300
Speaker 0: You have a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game, or it's a game.

101
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,780
Speaker 0: It's a challenge where I want to get as many people into a centralized location as possible.

102
00:36:51,540 --> 00:37:03,680
Speaker 0: I actually have to distribute them into different physical locations governed by my technological capability, both in terms of being able to get resources in and energy out, and in terms of just the limits of my ability to put them together.

103
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 0: So I have to convert them into functional adjuncts to the centralized system.

104
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,580
Speaker 1: Just to illustrate, here comes the roads.

105
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
Speaker 1: That's why every empire builds roads.

106
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,120
Speaker 0: Here comes the roads.

107
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,640
Speaker 0: Yes, here comes the roads, and or canals, and or eventually trains, right?

108
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,200
Speaker 0: And so exactly.

109
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Speaker 0: So lacking roads, there's only so much I can do.

110
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,460
Speaker 0: Oh wait, if I smooth out the land and make it more level, I can increase my throughput back and forth.

111
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,720
Speaker 0: Oh, neat, right?

112
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,140
Speaker 1: Awesome.

113
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,180
Speaker 0: And if I can bring water in, I can increase the number of people who could be in.

114
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,320
Speaker 0: Neat.

115
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,860
Speaker 0: And that's why viaducts.

116
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:33,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

117
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,220
Speaker 1: Exactly why.

118
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,540
Speaker 1: And so my ability to produce wealth and innovation is fighting against the actual constraints of the environment.

119
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,140
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

120
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,840
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

121
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,540
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

122
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,260
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

123
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,100
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

124
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,740
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

125
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,400
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

126
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

127
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,920
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

128
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

129
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,840
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

130
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,500
Speaker 0: And that's why I'm doing this.

131
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,640
Speaker 0: If I can solve those puzzles to unlock a next stage of growth, I get to grow.

132
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:57,340
Speaker 0: If I can't, then I reach some limit, and then I end up falling, collapsing in some fashion as this tension starts to break.

133
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,060
Speaker 0: As more and more people are coming in, I can't sustain it.

134
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,620
Speaker 0: I start getting more and more waste that I can't produce, or I get conflicts internally for scarce resources, and I get a collapse of them.

135
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,800
Speaker 0: So that's the city, right?

136
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,560
Speaker 0: And the city, as you can see, every civilization is ultimately actually the name of a city.

137
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,320
Speaker 0: Babylon is a really good one.

138
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,560
Speaker 0: It's a really good way of thinking of it.

139
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,000
Speaker 0: Okay, so what's next?

140
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:40,220
Speaker 1: Just before we move next, just, I'm sure you've thought of it, but just, again, to my audience, what you've been describing, while you were describing this, I couldn't get rid of a feeling that it was sophisticated, scientific, and eloquently put in technological language, the story of the Tower of Babylon, just to be very clear.

141
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,280
Speaker 1: Like, it's, like, it can be summarized in six.

142
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,400
Speaker 1: Paragraphs as it's done in Genesis, but effectively it's the same principle.

143
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:59,860
Speaker 1: You have multiplicity, like, it comes together, this multiplicity produce technological innovation, the, like, the bricks, as it is in the story, and we can see that all technology is, in a way, a form of a brick

144
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,440
Speaker 0: for us,

145
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,920
Speaker 1: then it goes on and on and on and on until it crumbles effectively under its own weight.

146
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,480
Speaker 1: But here, yeah, like, I have a video with Richard O'Froland on the channel, actually, too, about the Babylon.

147
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,640
Speaker 1: There are many, many male layers to it.

148
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,840
Speaker 1: And maybe it will be useful for us to talk about them later.

149
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:27,580
Speaker 1: But I just want to point out that the problem itself, maybe the scale of the problem nowadays, it's pretty big, but it's interesting that in our stories, the problem is already discussed on this scale.

150
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:35,500
Speaker 1: Like, as the biggest imaginable unity, what would happen if the biggest imaginable unity comes together?

151
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think this is absolutely correct.

152
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:48,540
Speaker 0: And so, you know, as I sort of have entered into the third phase of my, of my life, let's say, I can read that story and go, Oh, right.

153
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:56,760
Speaker 0: Oh, and it's, for me, very nice, because I can point to the world, let's say, scientifically, historically, and go, Yeah.

154
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,220
Speaker 0: That's actually, this is not, this is not just a really nice symbol.

155
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,140
Speaker 0: It is in fact, I can really concretely say, here's examples of how it operated and operates.

156
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,620
Speaker 0: Okay.

157
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,840
Speaker 0: And so, but here's the, here's the key point.

158
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:41,980
Speaker 0: And the, so I'd like to say to the King's side of things which is culture and civilization are not the same right they're in fact distinct um and it is not obvious nor do i think it's in fact i would say that the the logic of the model that i've been producing is that as i said civilization as a form is coming to an end we're actually reaching the end of that entire arc and let me explain a piece of that

159
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,320
Speaker 1: like a just a small yeah

160
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:56,740
Speaker 0: remember that in the beginning the proposition was that there was a tension between the generative capability the exponential collaborative capacity that emerges when you get minds into collaboration and the challenge of embodiment

161
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,680
Speaker 1: okay

162
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:11,320
Speaker 0: well of course over the last few years and particularly in the over the last sort of couple of decades the power of the digital among other things has enabled more and more and more of us to do what you and i are doing i don't know if you've noticed but we're not in the same room

163
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,120
Speaker 1: you we are unfortunately but we are not i would prefer

164
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:27,520
Speaker 0: i would prefer it is preferable but here's the key it makes a difference we are collaborating our minds are in some meaningful degree of communication right a lot lot lot better than if we were just texting back and forth

165
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,580
Speaker 1: um

166
00:41:29,120 --> 00:42:35,160
Speaker 0: maybe a million times better than if we were sending letters back and forth because the rate is as much faster i can see your facial expressions i can hear the tone of your voice um and so the the critical points of what enables collaboration to occur which is still embodied but now we're embodying it in an increasingly ephemeral form which means that the center of the city is moving and i'm just going to assert this the center of the city is moving from the place where human bodies do human body things into the virtual and i would argue that we've already moved that center or are very close to the moving of that center and when that occurs it's very interesting i think in fact it's ultimately really really good though by no means not fraught it is fraught with risk but it's not nonetheless very very good here's here's the the shift once you have liberated the body from the tyranny of being forced into unnatural uh proximity right the city the city is a deeply unnatural proximity yeah it's not healthy for human beings

167
00:42:35,820 --> 00:43:19,040
Speaker 1: because i think that was kind of missed in the previous uh state that city itself is not natural like as an not as an idea but as a phenomenon like we are biologically and socially are not really meant to live in the cities and that's why again it's interesting that in a scripture city has this very ambivalent role like abraham leaves the cities like and it's there is a constant call like exit the babylon exit the city like so there is there is all like book of exodus like so there is always this tension of it and it i don't think it's uh on empty spot and your line is another way of highlighting why there is an internal tension of certain need to exit the city so yeah yeah

168
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:46,820
Speaker 0: and there's there's many many right the the psychological the physiological and the spiritual consequences of the city are profound and almost entirely negative but the material benefit of of forcing people into that space is very powerful and so we've kind of been imposed into the tyranny of that but as soon as that center moves into the virtual um it's like imagine if the sun somehow just just disappeared and the planets were no longer governed by the gravitational pull of the sun

169
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,500
Speaker 1: somehow

170
00:43:47,540 --> 00:45:44,520
Speaker 0: we were able to maintain warmth but just look at that think about that from physics right there's some new center some new gravitational subject that's going to ultimately become that which governs maybe jupiter or maybe the planets disappear but the point is in our case in fact the new center has emerged the new center is now however beautifully pulling in two different directions one direction is human beings are going to be doing what we've been doing which is finding ways to get better and better at entering into collaboration in the virtual which i'm gonna i want to tag that in it and come back to that in a second and and however we then are now going to begin noticing more and more that we're becoming liberated to reorient our physical bodies in natural contexts and so we'll begin to actually live with our families for example form extended kin groups in places where everybody actually feels like the place they're in is a good place taking responsibility for the natural environment we're in because that's just obviously good from the point of view of beauty from the point of view of health right to the end and by the way noticing something like continuity again we sort of re-establish a sense of timelessness that is still in time like time and timelessness connecting properly we're almost getting back to that point of eternity in kairos um and we're already beginning to notice this and my proposition is that we'll begin to notice it more and more and more as the legacy inertia of urbanism begins to fade and as more and more and more people are able to move into places that more aligned with their more natural proclivities we will notice things like their birth rates will go up just as just as simple as that like just run the math on that people who live in natural places where they are you know there are groups of people who care for each other deeply and will care for newborn baby women feel comfortable we'll have decided to have children birth rates will go up and the cities will collapse out of just sheer

171
00:45:45,060 --> 00:46:01,120
Speaker 1: lack of producing and just just strengthen simply there is space to bring the children up like you're not confined to your 50 square meter 30 square meter cell in a megapolis exactly like it's not exactly a child encouraging environment

172
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:51,760
Speaker 0: and just think like we have fresh air running around nature all the good vital things that will make a human being be things like will be interested in meeting other people and interested in capable of mating and all that other good stuff so there's a lot more but you can see like how these i suspect deeply these transitions will begin to move and then you know the key challenge is how do we hold these two points in proper harmony how do we hold the virtual and the physical which i think now we can say how do we hold the transcendent and the imminent in proper harmony um becomes the question so i would argue strongly that we are in fact just flat out at the end of civilization under the terms of its own logic regardless of anything that we would like to do that's just we can't help it we're just at that stage but what that looks like is very much open open question

173
00:46:53,740 --> 00:51:53,960
Speaker 1: oh well several thoughts immediately come to mind one i think is crucial that from my perspective on a philosophical level we do have an answer like like it's old answer but i think it's answer to be rediscovered and you mentioned the tension between effectively virtual and material you can say and the true bridge answer and in my opinion not just in my opinion here i'm just repeating effectively what is well known in orthodox theology and like it's the antidote to both because virtual is not real enough and material is not spirited enough is symbolic like symbol is something which you embody like the problem of embodiment so giving the immaterial meaning because all meanings are immaterial by nature to sense a meaningless matter and that's exactly what our human if you want to say superpower or calling or duty or cross uh was from the very beginning we are meant to give exactly the meaning to the matter and to connect to connect heaven and earth to push it in at first but then you will have i think the very because to summarize the argument effectively you have to have that você effectively you're saying the city was is not good by itself but only by a very specific function which is which is which it enables and this function is of communication and communication enables collaboration and with the development of new technology for the first time we can at least conceive moving this constructive beneficial element of a city into the virtual space and leaves the negative element of it behind but i want to connect the problem of communication not exactly the problem but i think what enables communication it's not just the closed proximity and that's what i think is the key because i don't think it's a coincidence that in english that communication and communion are very closely connected words i think you can properly communicate and collaborate collaborate only as long as you have a certain level of communion between people who are entering in a certain paradigm of relation and one way of city of doing it you can think it was the way of doing it you can think it was the way of doing it in a very mean fashion artificially but like yeah holding everyone together let's say but it is form of communion maybe not exactly voluntarily maybe not exactly nicely done but it is what will happen when you move virtually it is an open question that's when i think is basically the kingswardian as you put it element comes into comes into play because can you have the culture without communion for example my answer no because i think as far as i understand the culture it is effectively a religion culture cult religion so what unites people in a certain culture it is a common common cult like if you want to put it this way and this will present and this does present a real i think challenge for the transition like i'm not arguing with you that the transition has already happened i do agree with you it's like there is inertia and there is a way of looking at it but i totally on you that theity in a way it was conceived and it was yeah for million a the cornerstoneursday had lost already lost its importance and it's just the nature of habit old thinking time but it will it will collapse pretty quickly maybe in the next decade already like depending on the speed but speed is the question but then the true problems i think will emerge the true problem is effect is a the problem of communion it's a problem of symbols what are this what are these immaterial symbols which are immaterial material symbols between the trends between the care into holding our decentralized place together it's a problem of violence and because it's exactly the problem of unity and multiplicity on another scale and uh you especially after your baptism i think you kind of it's not a new thought to you for you but also for the audience in the same manner that antidote for war is not peace but liturgy kind of the antidote for civilization is not barbarism and but church and that's where i think we will have the true challenge because we spent 400 years running exactly from this ontology and it's pretty challenging for us even just to pronounce these words not in the context of a very particular confined space which we kind of put a you know spiritual reservation okay that's the kind of spiritual reservation but it has nothing to do with the rest of our life whereas and correct me if i'm wrong effectively what you end up not proposing but observing is like to exit the the capital z crisis of civilizations you will not just have to embrace it but you have to make this the part of everything and that

174
00:51:55,700 --> 00:53:48,820
Speaker 0: yes i think this is right so um this is i think quite beautiful i don't know if you've noticed but we've actually in our conversation have actually moved through these phases so now we're sitting in the christian phase um so let's begin to use that language um so one of the the things that i have noticed in the nature of how the adversary or the serpent operates is that he tries to give us back the thing that he has taken by his own means right so when we fall from eternity the serpent bites his own tail and gives us the closed circle and says well that's eternity right it's infinite you can keep going around it um similarly the alternative to say true communion which is what the the this particular version of the adversary can give us i call temptation and so communion is when a multiplicity is in fact brought together into a well-integrated unity a proper hole temptation is when a bunch of pieces are put together are brought together into a non-well-integrated hole like a simple example is like a um a snowball or even a sand ball i can i can with enough force right with enough material generated wealth and innovation i can hold a non-integrated multiplicity into something kind of like communion but i'm going to call it temptation right and so uh and this is one of the reasons why civilizations collapse is they don't actually have a true center if they don't actually have a true communion that holds them together as a thing that is actually whole they are held together by some other kinds of forces and as those forces reach the end of their binding strength the real natural state is they're apart um and of course remember the the history of civilization has in fact been cosmopolitan imperialism which is quite explicitly the bringing together of parts into something like a non-well integrated hole usually by some combination of force

175
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:49,560
Speaker 1: and

176
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,380
Speaker 0: wealth or

177
00:53:51,300 --> 00:55:06,540
Speaker 1: uh complicated like some not good face some good face like there is there i would i would be less critical i would say there was always dual duality of this like because you can say that every time historical empire emerges like starting from persian empire into roman empire yes there is wealth coercion force like history is written of it but also then there is within it much more voluntarily element of pieces joining together as we tend to think like there is a very internal dynamic of like things trying to fall apart and things trying to not fall apart and yes what you're saying does play a role or every time but it's not justice like because when you bring crowds and you bring this infrastructure it's not just you keep together but yeah you're exactly stopping the let's say three kingdoms fighting each other like there is this like now we are all over us like it was effectively the persian model because all continental empires are built over it so how that like cyrus is the great he stopped the internal squabbling and created the empire and this dynamic i think is very important to keep up in mind like

178
00:55:07,140 --> 00:56:30,180
Speaker 0: i'm going to propose that this is ultimately grounded in the tower of babel right because cyrus is the great right cyrus is by means of human ingenuity human will human design producing something which is a simulacrum of communion that does throw off a very large number of benefits not the least of which is something like lowercase p piece yes okay w wealth all of which are real but all of which are also separate or different from what it the king of kings is proposing right yes you mean and we can do this there's lots of different variations on this you can also talk about the difference of like capital j judgment and accusation and judgment brings things into a proper balance separates that which needs to be separated accusation breaks apart things that in fact should be together so um i think this is and so let's say so the there's a mania is that right yeah there's a certain mania it's a perfect is actually perfectly identified as a mania to the degree to which humans particularly ones who identify as or endeavor to be identified as or endeavor to be identified as or endeavor to be identified as or great even if they don't think of themselves as great endeavor to produce this kind of pseudo communion by means of human skillfulness technique methodology which by the way of course then means on the right-hand shoulder is in fact the adversary then they are ultimately participating in the same sensibility of the tower about babel

179
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,180
Speaker 1: uh have you read the i imagine you read the goethe faust

180
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,000
Speaker 0: yes yes i've been thinking about him a lot in the past few days actually

181
00:56:39,740 --> 00:57:18,060
Speaker 1: well it is exactly the story so you're trading your reason like like in the very beginning like basically you're getting the power of uh you're trading your soul for the super power of reason over material reality yeah and uh in the second half of the book which people rarely read because long and boring but by the end like it's interesting that what he ends up is a megalomaniac civilizational project yeah do you remember that he tries to build the system of canals and dams and the only thing which was standing in his way was just this little cottage with two old people who just didn't want to move out to build his megalomaniac uh common good project and that's how kind of when falling apart happens

182
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,360
Speaker 0: yeah

183
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,200
Speaker 1: yeah i think it's just very there is something in it like connected to what you're talking about

184
00:57:23,460 --> 00:58:55,000
Speaker 0: and you can do an interesting case study if i just think about the napoleonic archetype and this notion or the the uh the the julian line it even has to have to be an individual or the migration at the beginning is something that's you know αποStr2004 dynamic happening intergenerationalist i mean it seems to be a thing that happens for reasons that i think we would notice so so so then we're calling to the deeper right the the communion is at the ground and of course we have advantage of the ability to have access to communion proper proper true communion and true communion is that for to which we have yearned and the question is how are we able to find how do we say this right moment that we are afforded where simultaneously the tyranny of civilization is in a process of breaking so we're in a kind of free fall and where everything is is necessary right the necessity is as high as it could possibly be how are we able to find a way to be drawn towards true communion and not to be lured into simulated or false communion um and i think you got this word this notion of symbolism this notion of the proper role of human in bringing together heaven and earth and king snorts i think again i just want to orient him civilization is over brother you don't have to worry about it yes you're right we're done what comes next is not atavistic what comes next is

185
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:55,520
Speaker 1: a

186
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:59,060
Speaker 0: qualitatively different thing of what it looks like when we're actually able to choose to live in accordance with true communion and then come from from there and of course in this case true communion is communion horizontally but most importantly vertically right the horizontal happens because the vertical happens and the vertical happens individually and collectively right so each individual is in communion vertically through through the son into the father the group comes together the group now forms the church which are all in community as the son with the father means a very complex thing that happens and i can't say that this is sort of like capital t the thing the kingdom of heaven but i can say that the thing that we would be speaking of when we mention the kingdom of heaven is the direction the only possible valid direction always has been but in this case quite concretely and we can even begin to notice methodologies like how do we actually what does it even look like here's an example that's one thing i

187
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,860
Speaker 1: wanted to bring up yeah

188
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:36,440
Speaker 0: um when we think about the virtual i can put the virtual here and then i can put the spiritual over here they're clearly not the same but they're weirdly weirdly proximal you know i could think of like the the minimum viable embodiment of let's just use math it's like a very easy concrete way to think about something that participates more in the spiritual than most things the minimum viable embodiment of math happens to show up in the virtual i can i can take two numbers and i can add them together in software right in a computer

189
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,540
Speaker 1: okay

190
01:00:37,580 --> 01:01:00,440
Speaker 0: or frankly even just in my head but in a computer particularly and what i'm doing is something in computer science one might even say is the study of the limit of embodiment the minimum viable embodiment that allows the actual embodied relationship with the transcendent which is a weird priesthood but maybe that's exactly what we need to do catechize all computer scientists

191
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:29,820
Speaker 1: that definitely will help at least with something given some demonic elements in it i like and i'm not over exaggerating you know the better like yeah like the type of people sometimes interacting no i just want to come back to the and suggest like the way i understand it exactly speaking about the difference between virtual and symbolical like what's the con what what is the connection and where the difference happen and it is linguistic so maybe you will

192
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,080
Speaker 0: the principle

193
01:01:31,220 --> 01:02:15,760
Speaker 1: you can agree with the principle but try to explain differently to me when i try to explain the difference between virtual and symbolical between virtual and exactly let's say spiritual is uh if uh virtual is uh so both are immaterial what i think is very important like what is the common parameter between them is that they're both immaterial it is true but where are the differences at least in our understanding in and over treatment we treat virtual in material at least we claim to treat virtual and material and interact living dogs to be Schlagenstein shore화면 project o right yeah yes so with the violation only sometimes and in their case są angod A hydroka It's something not real enough or not real at all, whereas spiritual is super real, it is beyond real.

194
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,980
Speaker 1: So both are immaterial, but it's kind of the choice.

195
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:24,900
Speaker 1: You can move into illusion, simulation of reality, which by definition is not reality.

196
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:36,360
Speaker 1: Simulation of something is not the thing, so simulation of reality is not reality, whereas spiritual is more than real.

197
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,000
Speaker 1: It's real beyond real, if you want to put it this way.

198
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:45,240
Speaker 1: And I think here comes like practical solution, what we have to do, and collectively and individually, et cetera.

199
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,580
Speaker 1: At this stage of flood, I do agree we are in the process of flood of the city turning into maybe seaview as you propose, maybe flood will be longer, not know yet.

200
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,760
Speaker 1: But at this stage, it's important to look for the right words.

201
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:11,800
Speaker 1: That's an old principle, because I do think we have on the linguistic level, a lot of mess to put mildly, not being able to properly converse about the most quintessential matters.

202
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,600
Speaker 1: It is a big challenge.

203
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:30,240
Speaker 1: And here, rediscovery of the language of old is actually helpful, because the more you go into the tradition, especially of the first Christianity of the first millennium, the more you read the writings of Saint Basil, Saint Maximus, and Gregory, you would be surprised.

204
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,060
Speaker 1: How, as I'm talking about, this is exactly the same effectively problems we are talking right now.

205
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:43,600
Speaker 1: Like, yes, the language sounds a little like quite differently, but once you move past beyond your first, let's say, reaction, you would see this much more close.

206
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:51,040
Speaker 1: And that's just as experience of people since writing about this not material, but super real things.

207
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,600
Speaker 1: And that changes your understanding.

208
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:53,440
Speaker 0: Okay.

209
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,820
Speaker 0: So notice we're actually doing, again, we're becoming self-referential, and I think we can combine things really beautifully.

210
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:05,080
Speaker 0: So language, okay.

211
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,380
Speaker 0: And the medium of expression, that's actually even a better way of putting it.

212
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:19,220
Speaker 0: So if I'm reading Basil, I am communing with him by means of a medium of expression.

213
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,340
Speaker 0: That medium of expression has at least two elements.

214
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,060
Speaker 0: One, as you say, is in fact the way that the transcendent is embodying itself in a particular instantiation.

215
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,460
Speaker 0: The word hypostasis is good here.

216
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:50,140
Speaker 0: The way the transcendent is hypostatically bound to the material, to the world, in the form of the language, the Greek language, and secondarily, but not separately, in the form of the actual transmission of the written word to my eyeball, the physicality of the written word.

217
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,100
Speaker 1: And the third, there is a third, and the third is you, the matter of perception.

218
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,020
Speaker 1: Yes.

219
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:58,560
Speaker 1: Yes.

220
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:07,260
Speaker 1: The matter of a subject, because I think that's one topic we didn't talk yet about in what is crucial in this transition, is the whole re-understanding of the problem.

221
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:12,340
Speaker 1: Not problem, but the reality of the subject, because it's how you perceive certain things.

222
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:19,280
Speaker 1: It's very ironic that we live in the age which pretends that everything is subjective, but effectively there is no real place for subject.

223
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,020
Speaker 1: There is no true recipient of this.

224
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:22,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

225
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,660
Speaker 0: Well, let's do it just right now.

227
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,940
Speaker 0: Right between us, this is perfect.

228
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:25,300
Speaker 0: Right?

229
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,720
Speaker 0: So you are a subject.

230
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,760
Speaker 0: I am a subject.

231
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,280
Speaker 0: I am a subject.

232
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:39,140
Speaker 0: What we're trying to figure out how to do is to come into a relationship of connection at the level of the transcendent subjective, right?

233
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,520
Speaker 0: In the interior of me, in the interior of you, we can somehow find the same location in the mind of God.

234
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:57,080
Speaker 0: We're having to use this virtual medium, which by the way now has this really interesting characteristic of being, if we were in the same physical space, we may actually be still saying we're using a virtual medium.

235
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:10,820
Speaker 0: Or maybe we're using a virtual light and sound to orient our physical bodies as instrumentalities of our will, soul and spirit, ultimately allowing us to orient at the level of our spiritual into connection.

237
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,660
Speaker 0: And there's something about that.

238
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,640
Speaker 0: Like liturgy, that is liturgy.

239
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,360
Speaker 0: That is liturgy.

240
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,760
Speaker 0: That's all liturgy is, is that.

241
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:27,300
Speaker 0: And so to render the virtual liturgical, I would say is the cardinal challenge of the moment that we're in.

242
01:06:28,360 --> 01:08:20,920
Speaker 0: i'll take it up a notch like king's north is correctly pointed out that if we're operating at the level of christian civilization we're actually not even thinking clearly civilization fortunately is coming to it well fortunately unfortunately is coming to an end and there's nothing about the endeavoring to reconstitute it as a christian that's going to be meaningful at all and may have negative consequences will will have negative consequences for the christian side but okay we're now moving into a new place in this new place we are now able to quite clearly see that the thing that we are endeavoring to always do is convert the virtual and here now i'm including all forms of the imminent into the liturgical because the effort is always as you say and your arrow is exactly right if our arrow is pointing down from the spiritual to the embodied to the virtual then we're moving towards the less than lesser real we can actually instead of making it like one two three it's just a continuum of less than less real in some sense all we're trying to do is convert that to some you something about the nature of the fact that we are physical and we heaven and earth the creation is created there's a reason for it and we have a role to play in it part of our role to play in it is to come into relationships with each other by means of the created by means of the virtual by means of the physical by means of the imminent in order to allow us to connect at the level of the spiritual and up and up and up right you and i when we connect at the level of the spiritual something else happens is that the holy spirit is there with us watching right whenever we're together in his name in his name capital n name then he is with us right and so that is the that is it like that's the challenge and it's funny because i can split that challenge in two ways one challenge is that is actually just the thing that we're here to do full stop it always has been and also it is the only viable approach to solve the problem of the catastrophe of the transition from civilization

243
01:08:23,140 --> 01:10:10,180
Speaker 1: right i really like the way you combine the two things and like yeah i do agree it's not like obviously but it is the only way out of this meta crisis which we started our conversation because and that's why it's important to first step to recognize it as such you're doing it on like your work and podcast but that's why i think this conversation today was very important because so far it is not that easy let me put it this way because exactly 400 years of legacy is huge like and we can look even deeper we we can look even deeper beyond it but let's say that at least the last iteration of this capital seed civilization is the modernity which is the particular very particular version of the same civilization which has very particular understanding of reality per se which has led to which has been replicated over 400 years like even though being parasitical in nature it provided less gigantic material boons and often it isn't it is funny because often when like i talk about these problems with even my like students or clients uh often fear and i think you might have exactly in your life as well that okay so do you propose that we go into let's say just immediate courses and destroy like basically ludism like like the idea when you're talking about the collapse of the civilization you're talking immediately about ludism and that the idea of this material technological progress is embedded into civilization and honestly the answer is yes it is but not just and i think that's what you've been trying to show like it is embedded but it's not the connection is not just linear connection and it's not straightforward connection

244
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,740
Speaker 0: and it's not it's not it's not it's it's not anything

245
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,240
Speaker 1: essential

246
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:32,060
Speaker 0: it is not essential in this in this sense meaning technological innovation is what causes civilization not the other way around and that there are ways to achieve technological innovation that are separate from civilization

247
01:10:32,120 --> 01:11:39,220
Speaker 1: wow that's big yes i i think that i i think that's the key whereas the so far at least we've been only highlighting at least in a let's say secular discourse we've been only been highlighting the constructive material elements of civilization as a facilitator of the technological process and uh been really neglecting this uh spiritual but also you can say immaterial problems civilization entails by itself which was always preserved in a tradition at least but not just the hospital not just a christian tradition like most of the traditions globally are very cautious about the problems of civilizations like even being simple question of the you know more small and big cities like and we have the tablets from babylonian age people complaining about it but even on a bigger level because there is a certain like we didn't go deep into it but there is a certain price you have to pay in a cto exactly uh effectively nominalistic price you you need to you need to atomize yourself like nominalism you know nice yeah absolutely

248
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:48,040
Speaker 0: but that's really good a good phrase the nominalistic price is beautiful you can almost feel like you can feel that selling of the soul sensibility

249
01:11:48,760 --> 01:12:00,800
Speaker 1: yeah uh and that's exactly the challenge because the problem is even though So we managed to create a really good, let's say, I don't know, multiplicators, transistors, et cetera.

250
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,580
Speaker 1: Let's say for every X element of you, you're getting more and more material.

251
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,520
Speaker 1: And hence now we live in the wealthiest material civilization ever existed.

252
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,640
Speaker 1: We live as kings.

253
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,320
Speaker 1: Let's be straightforward.

254
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:17,160
Speaker 1: Even the poorest, maybe not the poorest man of us, but the poorest man in America lives like a king.

255
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,580
Speaker 1: Like by material standards of the civilization of age.

256
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:27,480
Speaker 1: But the price you had to pay is the most lonely people ever walked the planet Earth.

257
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,720
Speaker 1: And there is this intrinsic connection.

258
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:38,540
Speaker 1: And I absolutely agree with you that I think that is exactly the lie and the deal, which is kind of proposed to us, that you can have this, but only with this.

259
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,580
Speaker 1: Like you can't, these two things are separate.

260
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,720
Speaker 1: And it takes time to really realize whether they are, how they're connected, what is the connection.

261
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,400
Speaker 1: I think you've been doing it very beautifully.

262
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:49,520
Speaker 1: But.

263
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:49,940
Speaker 1: Thank you.

264
01:12:50,420 --> 01:13:01,440
Speaker 1: But this nominalistic price, just to hammer down this point, and I think it's important, we need to understand that it is one of the reasons why this civilization is ending, because by its very nature, it is limited.

265
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:07,420
Speaker 1: There is only so much humanness in any part, every particular human you can give.

266
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:19,260
Speaker 1: You already get effectively given your nation, like you'll say, you're mostly given your culture, you're mostly given your nation, you mostly have given away your family, like because we can talk a lot about the structure.

267
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:19,980
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

268
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:43,920
Speaker 1: Age, like to an extent, and sex, go on into this, and the only thing left, basically, it's, I would say at this rate, life itself, like this whole question of like, just living, like physically, like producing, you know, chemical and physical elements, but basically, we've given up almost everything for this current price without really realizing it.

269
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:49,140
Speaker 1: There is not much more to give, but the imperative of constant doubling is not disappeared.

270
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,400
Speaker 1: So it simply cannot make sense.

271
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,920
Speaker 1: It's not a step without collapsing.

272
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,840
Speaker 1: So just even on this symbolic level, it makes total sense with you've been describing in a technical terms.

273
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:56,920
Speaker 0: Wow.

274
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's beautiful.

275
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:12,240
Speaker 0: It's, and it's wild, because as you say, if I take that lens, that way of looking at it, and I trace all the way back all these different elements of the poly crisis, we can see that they actually all have showed this, their symptoms of the same thing.

276
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

277
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,020
Speaker 0: So I can say, okay, let me look at the debasement of the currency.

278
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:16,840
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

279
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:17,500
Speaker 0: I get it.

280
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,060
Speaker 0: This maps.

281
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:18,880
Speaker 0: This is what's happening.

282
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,940
Speaker 0: You know, counterfeiting everything.

283
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,920
Speaker 0: Becoming counterfeit currency.

284
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:21,620
Speaker 0: That's what's happening.

285
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:41,080
Speaker 0: When I take a look at stories, you know, let's just take a look at something like, I don't know, even just like something that's been all of Star Wars and the strip my Star Wars for over time, like to the degree to which a teenager, a Jewish teenager, the 1930s could produce something connected to the divine in the form of Marvel, or I guess he's in the 40s.

286
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:47,420
Speaker 0: And then the strip mining of that into the super salient, the purely super salient with no soul left over like 99.99%.

287
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,060
Speaker 0: And then you're 0.0001% soul.

288
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,620
Speaker 0: And there's a point in which it just the whole thing just topples over and you're seeing that ever food.

289
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,800
Speaker 0: You know, we'd seen everywhere.

290
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,280
Speaker 0: It's weird.

291
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,240
Speaker 0: Actually, if you think about it like, wow, it's weird.

292
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,340
Speaker 0: It's weird that it would show up so mechanistically independent, like everything.

293
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,460
Speaker 0: And I can just think about it right and notice how that happens.

294
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,020
Speaker 0: Okay.

295
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,600
Speaker 0: So there we go.

296
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:10,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

297
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,300
Speaker 1: So to sum it up, we do live in a very interesting age and in a very interesting time.

298
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,620
Speaker 1: Like, I do think we do live in a meta crisis.

299
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,580
Speaker 1: And.

300
01:15:19,320 --> 01:17:27,400
Speaker 1: just to sum it up and not to sum it up a final thought since we have a little bit more time and that's something you told me before we started the recording to end it on a more positive note i do think if there is one big spark of positivity in all of this mess is that we do have appetite and what is even more important maybe or equally as important capacity to at least look beyond this uh let's say puzzle represented an escapable puzzle the appetite is that i do think we want to leave and that's what coming back to the problem of crisis like the crisis will reveal whether we want to leave or we want to die you're gonna say this the only question we've been like in our personal life and civil and cultural life and like from the beginning to the end but the question of life versus death and communion is the ultimate form of life whether let's say by belong to our ultimate form of civilization but death like so that's all coming together and if we want to leave we do have we do have an appetite for it and there is so many thinkers and facilitators and material things happening right now which i only think are exactly liking the right words i honestly think based on our conversation and you and previous conversations we had like in private and like with other people we are much more developed materialism we think we are we're much stronger than referencing the economy it's really important right now to think about meaningfulness and usefulness as an example of that like it's exactly the question of that philosophy it's exactly the question of direction it's exactly the question of finding the right way of expressing this and directing this is the element and for the and for quite a while it was not let's be realistic it was good enough so has already been happening and it's only as a question of us what we're going to do with it so maybe do you want to conclude in some way or like just reflect on the whole journey um

301
01:17:31,780 --> 01:18:32,960
Speaker 0: yeah i mean the sense that i just i notice is that there's every time there's been a there's revelation the word revelation that you put in the revelatory experience of crisis every time the crisis has come to enough of a head to force people to look at it squarely some number of people have had some quality of revelation and that that desire to live and by the way that more even deeper that desire to come to communion let's just put it very very clearly that's the actual desire right the desire is to come into communion you know we've been turned upside down inside out and been put in blindfolds and somebody's lit lit a fire over there to make it feel like that's the right thing to do but the reality is is we desire communion and as the crisis comes to a peak more people have some set of revelations that orients them towards trying to find their way back onto the right path and that's the good news

302
01:18:34,760 --> 01:20:09,600
Speaker 1: well it is thank you very much i i think it was absolutely fascinating and wonderful topic as uh good conversations which we only touch the tips of the iceberg but i think the very fact that we had it and i'm really grateful for you to coming because exactly i will be honest a little bit of your background because like of this uh big tech you know uh very what we consider to be the most modern and even super modern post-modern man and the very fact of you talking about these problems in the manner you do and understanding them and reacting towards them is an effect symbolic like it is an effect symbolic like that this personal journey of reaching to a certain height but also it's kind of in a way the certain low and effectively making the certain jump through it like as a symbol just to finish like i think it is very symbolic to the whole meta crisis and my personal story and your personal story thing remember that in dante but i think it's one of the most fascinating uh small details in the whole story that the exit from hell is on its very bottom like it's effectively right right and be right behind the person like the ninth circle and then the dante ends up being walked into the purgatory well i think in a way like what is happening right now is a little bit akin to this story and then it is positive element to it so then thank you very much for coming

303
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,880
Speaker 0: yeah really delighted um i'm really excited to see what happens as a result of this conversation

304
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,920
Speaker 1: well hope we will have more that would be very very beautiful

305
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,160
Speaker 0: great

306
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,800
Speaker 1: hi brother okay
