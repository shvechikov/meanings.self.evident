1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:03,960
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,880
Speaker 1: Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,200
Speaker 1: Today I have a wonderful guest, Jonathan Pichot, for the second time on my channel, which makes me incredibly privileged and happy.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,280
Speaker 1: Thank you, Jonathan, for your time.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,880
Speaker 1: You're sincerely welcomed.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
Speaker 0: Oh, it's great to see you again, Pavel.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:32,940
Speaker 1: So what I want to explore today is, in effect, a continuation of our previous conversation, because there are many topics and themes raised back then.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:01:14,520
Speaker 1: like i think it was in may and much more but there is still much more to explore i will put in the link to this video an article which i published on a symbolic world which will be referenced quite often i think oh at least i hope several times during covers today conversation and so for everyone who wants please take a look so but my first question will be more general i noticed that Generally speaking, you tend to avoid talking about, let's say, political phenomenons in most of your conversations, videos, projects.

9
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:26,640
Speaker 1: There are some very huge notable exceptions, like your ARC paper, which I still recommend reading because it was a very interesting content for you to a little bit step into the field.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 1: But I can ask you a more broad question first.

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:47,480
Speaker 1: Could it be that... you might think that nowadays we kind of live in a time where political language is simultaneously an opposition to symbolic language and theological language, but also is used as a substitution to it.

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Speaker 0: Well, I think that my hesitation to talk about politics is mostly because I don't believe that the solution to our problem lies there uh and so that's one the second one is also because the political in the normal world is something which is should be very close to you right it's the it's the life of the polis it's the life of the city in which you live and it's and

13
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,740
Speaker 1: it's

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:34,160
Speaker 0: it should be understood as a place where you or your activity can make a difference you know and can can be part of the process of people getting along or not getting along or whatever.

15
00:02:35,300 --> 00:03:01,380
Speaker 0: And I think that one of the things that's happened, you know, let's say in the 20th century, since World War II, it's accelerating more and more, is the pervasiveness of political discourse on a global scale, which is that now we have this situation where we basically are pulled into discussions about what's happening everywhere in the world.

16
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,140
Speaker 0: And that is happening both in terms of media, but it's also happening in the West because of immigration.

17
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,200
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you go to downtown Montreal.

18
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,140
Speaker 0: I went to downtown Montreal a few weeks ago, and there's this huge demonstration of Venezuelans that are demonstrating about Venezuela in Montreal.

19
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,540
Speaker 0: And we know now that there are constant demonstrations about Palestine everywhere.

20
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:56,000
Speaker 0: in the rest of the world and so one of the things that the kind of globalism has done is that it's made politics everywhere everywhere right and that is to me that is destructive it's destructive personally to the person to think that they are always concerned about everything that happens everywhere in the world That is destructive to the person, but I also think it's destructive to the actual polis, which is the actual participation in your everyday life.

21
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,440
Speaker 0: So, you know, we have this idea and I suffer from the same problem, which is that the real stakes are here at the national level.

22
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,380
Speaker 0: You know, Trump versus Harris.

23
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,980
Speaker 0: That's what really matters.

24
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,620
Speaker 0: But get involved in my own town, in my own community, in my own.

25
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's boring.

26
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,500
Speaker 0: Like that doesn't make a difference.

27
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,740
Speaker 0: Right.

28
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:22,720
Speaker 0: So I think that this is one of the reasons why I don't talk especially about international politics very much.

29
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,900
Speaker 0: Like you said, there are some notable exceptions.

30
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:40,860
Speaker 0: The ARC paper was there mostly because I think that it was there to introduce a different way of thinking about politics, a different way of thinking about identity, which I think is a better solution to the culture war and all the madness that you see of people.

31
00:04:41,500 --> 00:05:28,920
Speaker 0: getting sucked into every little nonsense and you know all the political commentators uh because i kind of follow some of them and i can watch them just you know it's just hook bite and then you go you go in uh there are bigger questions to ask like even in terms of politics sorry i'm going so long on this but i think it's important the outset you know is also one of the things people don't ask enough is why am i asked to care about this particular thing right now that has nothing to do with me you know what what are the forces which are making me care about this conflict and i don't even know that this conflict exists like somalia is being bombed every day I never heard about it.

32
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,540
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

33
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,040
Speaker 0: Really?

34
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,340
Speaker 0: Somalia is being bombed every day?

35
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, Somalia is being bombed every day and it's been happening for years.

36
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:49,880
Speaker 0: And this is the situation where you have these weird things where conflicts all of a sudden become salient artificially, I think, for certain reasons and others have just ignored and it's on the international scale.

37
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,240
Speaker 0: You could say... On the local scale, you know why certain things become salient.

38
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,080
Speaker 0: It's because they're relevant to my life.

39
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:12,240
Speaker 0: If the town here decides to put a highway over my house, then I'm going to care about that and I'm going to get involved in the polis and involved in the politics and go to the meetings and fight for my participation in this city.

40
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:21,940
Speaker 0: So all of these are the things that people, I think, have to remember constantly, which is that I'm Canadian.

41
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,240
Speaker 0: i'm not american i am not gonna get involved in american politics or at least very little because it's just not my country yeah

42
00:06:30,280 --> 00:07:54,340
Speaker 1: i think you raised several important questions in your answer which is always a great mark basically and it kind of comes to the problem which i think the key issue is that the language of political you're absolutely right when you were describing these problems which comes up to mind when even we raise the question of politics or community in modern day language etc like politics must be something big something flashy something from the outside but don't you think that one of the main reasons for it is pretty fundamental that our very basic understanding of exactly what community is what the policy is is simply off the mark and it's been on some mark let's say not for like today or yesterday but for i would argue at least 400 years and i think the way to help people to understand what i mean by this is to highlight the link between community and community and i think that's where the language of symbolism can come into play like i don't know if you thought about it but basically it would be interesting to hear your opinion because i think it's on a very on the surface if you start thinking about it but at the same time it has a very huge implications so if you think that community is not just a contract like it's connected with the bigger reality what do you like

43
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,240
Speaker 0: no i don't you

44
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,880
Speaker 1: agree with it

45
00:07:56,140 --> 00:09:06,920
Speaker 0: no i completely agree you know by the way for people who haven't read the article uh i'm sure gonna link to it it's a it's a great article because it goes into you know some things that i talk about But it does it, quoting Hobbes directly and using examples directly in the Enlightenment of how there's a transformation that's being brought about in terms of this notion, like you said, of something like the fact that we are these individuals that are free-floating and that we need to create a kind of illusion of unity in order to tamper our... passions and tamper the the wildness of the individual uh and that creates this serious problem which is which is definitely the one that we're in now and so it's possible even to think you don't necessarily address that directly in your article which is that the end point of thinking that right that we have these kind of artificial constructs that we create in order to tamper us and to you know that that The end of that is to say, well, couldn't we just have one for all people?

46
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,020
Speaker 0: Couldn't we just have one?

47
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,460
Speaker 0: Couldn't we just have a global state?

48
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,740
Speaker 0: Because anyways, it's all a kind of artificial construct anyways.

49
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,580
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

50
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,360
Speaker 0: And if we could do that, then we could just have one state and then a bunch of free-floating individuals.

51
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,600
Speaker 0: And that would be a kind of ideal of the vision.

52
00:09:26,880 --> 00:11:45,340
Speaker 1: Well, since you mentioned it, I think... basically what we are dealing with and that's why i'm a little bit one can say even pushing you with my question uh we're in a state where we i think actually need the language of symbolism and the language of even religious philosophy to talk about the most fundamental political things uh because it's all related to these processes as you like to say they are playing out like you cannot understand the drive for this global unification you cannot understand the drive for this creation of universal tower recover of babel uh on let's say this like actually i think it's happening right now there is happening like a big un summit with something together for the future where effectively is discussing again another version of the world government that's already like with global censorship with global control over resources all these things like and it's very easy to let's say brush it out as madness or exactly to talk about is let's say just for example like people like to do in a classical political analysis which you find so annoying that oh this is this power group and this one this and this one this and that is the secret plan for them to make more money out of this and you are missing the most important thing i think uh which is the actual first phone the uh statement of political theology because what political theology actually says that all political processes are theological and teleological processes in nature this in the same manner as let's say human life is teleological and theological and uh um like if we go into this then actually on the one hand everything becomes clear what is happening even in political reality but at the same time it becomes very difficult to talk to people who are not familiar with the language because such language become confronted to counterintuitive at the same time i would argue it is the only language we can which can actually explain why and what is happening and coming back to what i was writing and it's kind of my back question uh to you uh basically you support this idea or not that effectively for the last 400 years all uh let's say The key symbolic conflict.

53
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,560
Speaker 1: That's how symbolism comes into play.

54
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,720
Speaker 1: And I want maybe first for you to explain to other people the difference between symbolic and virtual.

55
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:04,120
Speaker 1: I think that's one of the very key understanding to understand the difference between in the nature of political processes, let's say, pre-enlightenment, pre-modernity and post-enlightenment, post-modernity.

56
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,360
Speaker 1: So if you can help.

57
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,780
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not sure I completely understand your question.

58
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not sure how it is you want me to, you know, because I think that I want to be careful.

59
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,060
Speaker 1: Okay, I will rephrase, basically.

60
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,940
Speaker 1: People, let's say, why symbol is not an illusion?

61
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,220
Speaker 1: Why symbol is more than just an illusion?

62
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, I think that like, because you can... A way to understand it is to understand it kind of fractally, right, as the person.

63
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,820
Speaker 0: And the fact that humans have multiplicity in them, we have different ideas.

64
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,960
Speaker 0: And Hobbes is right about that, right.

65
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Speaker 0: But what he's wrong about, and what he doesn't seem, at least in my perception to understand, is that those multiple desires are resolved, they're resolved in the person.

66
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,520
Speaker 0: and they should be, to some extent, resolved in the person, because that's the vector of unity of those desires.

67
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:32,280
Speaker 0: But once you start to think that, in some ways, they're out of control, that there's these out-of-control desires in you, and all you are is an unconscious stream of desire, not that you're not that, because we are that to some extent, then exactly this weird idea that the communion between us is not something which... which is real because he doesn't seem to see it at the level of the person already, right?

68
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
Speaker 0: And so it's these artificial constructs that are there.

69
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,080
Speaker 0: Whereas just as you can know that as a person, sometimes you get pulled in different directions.

70
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,000
Speaker 0: You can feel it inside you.

71
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Speaker 0: Everybody feels it.

72
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,080
Speaker 0: But you can also act with unitary purpose and unitary direction.

73
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,460
Speaker 0: And you can also experience that in you.

74
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,120
Speaker 0: And in the same way, humans are made to create or to participate in those bodies.

75
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Speaker 0: as persons with each other.

76
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:11,700
Speaker 0: And so the communion of love that you talk about in your article, which is really the true way in which people can bond together towards higher bodies, is already something that happens inside you.

77
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:23,460
Speaker 0: And to imagine these free-floating particles, that they're not by their own multiplicity.

78
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:57,520
Speaker 0: called to join into unity by that very fact and that there is such a thing as only multiplicity that type of that type of intuition is is wrong and it creates the problem that that we talk about which is in some ways to to understand the state as an artificial constraint that is top down on on free-floating particles whereas that is not that is not how it happens in you that's not how it happens in anything It's also not how it happens in people.

79
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,060
Speaker 0: It's weird how people, even the way that people think about the past, because we're so ruined by media and movies and stories.

80
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,500
Speaker 0: It's like a 15th century peasant loved the king.

81
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
Speaker 0: I know you don't like that.

82
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,700
Speaker 0: I know people don't like that.

83
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:15,960
Speaker 1: I like it.

84
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,660
Speaker 0: Most people don't like that because they think that, no, it's always just oppression.

85
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,340
Speaker 0: It's always like, no.

86
00:15:22,040 --> 00:16:04,220
Speaker 0: the 15th century president loved his king and the 15th century peasant would excuse the king constantly even sometimes wrongly would say oh the reason why the king is doing this is because he doesn't know like he doesn't know that there are people around you know like this is this is and the and you think that this is but this is totally natural like this is a natural way because we exist in this body and we have to live in this body and therefore to imagine always our leaders, as duplicitous and false and as power-hungry only as that, is to destroy the very communion in which we live.

87
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:16,720
Speaker 0: And so the way in which... let's say normal ancient societies function was usually like that so once in a while there could be obviously a horrible leader and that can happen

88
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,380
Speaker 1: quite

89
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:53,560
Speaker 0: often even be realistic even quite often exactly but even if that happened like you could be caught like you could be caught by lower forms of this right like let's say you get a really horrible king but then at the level of a lower level which is you know my my town my city my parish my community then you can get you can be caught by that right uh whereas in this vision of the free-floating passions of the person you know it's all it's just it's illusion and tyranny all the way all the way through you know but

90
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,200
Speaker 1: uh go on

91
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think that's what you were referring to, right?

92
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:10,500
Speaker 0: Which is that this idea that power structures, that what we consider power structures are just artificial and are not actually natural to the binding of people together.

93
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:31,940
Speaker 1: Well, I was actually referring even to slightly, I would say, more general problem, which is... What I think underlies the Hobbesian world, not Hobbes per se, but what we developed after it, the Enlightenment project, is even a bigger philosophical debate about what is real.

94
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,480
Speaker 1: I will bring it to it.

95
00:17:33,800 --> 00:18:46,460
Speaker 1: Because, let's say, if you consider that the only real thing is something which is quantifiable and something which is material, then automatically it leaves you with a way fewer... that's uh options for the way you see your society and the failures of your society you mentioned that for example peasants love the king and like they even were very tolerant to human mistake well one of the reasons because they were understanding that it is human like i i know very well you mean like in the folk stories and even like ethnography like even the 90s centuries russia basically the often peasants attitude towards let's say tsar was pity like they were pitting him because it's such a heavy effectively job to carry it's such a heavy cross to bear like it was understood as a cross and in a sense it is true but if you consider that the old reality is a mechanism that everything can be arranged rationally that everything can be let's say created perfectly to minimize the failures then you create you you end up in this vicious cycle vicious pattern And you lose the most important thing of what the communion is, even while you are still doing it.

96
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,560
Speaker 1: I think that's the key problem.

97
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,460
Speaker 0: You reduce communion to bureaucracy.

98
00:18:52,460 --> 00:19:26,560
Speaker 0: That's exactly what we saw in the modern state, which is the reality of... people living together and having to negotiate and to share and to, to have conflicts and all of that, you know, and that out of that, you need obviously to have certain people that are legislators that are rulers or whatever, but to transform that into a machine, like you said, a bureaucracy of, of management, you know, of management of, of statistics of people, you know, it leads to, I mean, yeah, it leads to what we have.

99
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,600
Speaker 1: However, like, I think it's not even that it's important to understand now, but it's only a first step.

100
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,500
Speaker 1: And that's what I think.

101
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,720
Speaker 1: I try to convey and maybe have future conversations to go into deeper because I think it's only tier one illusion.

102
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,120
Speaker 1: Like the truth is that despite that, that's what we think the community and politics is.

103
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,640
Speaker 1: We act in a completely different reality.

104
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 1: And what I mean is like I say, we can change the basic principles.

105
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:53,020
Speaker 1: of any of the functions of any unity and for this i'm very grateful for your question like basically what i'm saying regardless whether we think that a political community is a church it is still a church you might not think it is you might pretend it's a it's a rational agreement you might pretend that it is like something we like rational beings signed up here but it still functions according to the laws of political theological reality it still functions as a effective church it still is united by the same sacred center and it is exactly sacred and the very simple answer to it like how to prove it let's say to demonstrate is the attitude you don't treat it rationally you treat it something as a holy in case of america for example the declaration of independence it's not just a paper it's the same as the covenant it's the same as the ark of covenant like and it functions in the same way But we don't have the language to talk about it in the same way.

106
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,260
Speaker 1: And that's a huge gray zone where many different tricks are happening.

107
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Speaker 0: But you can also kind of see it as a progressive erosion, though, of that way of functioning, which is that, you know, let's say... And it's manifested in the breakdown, let's say, in the spreading out of the suburbs.

109
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,820
Speaker 0: I always use that example as a good example because my suburb has no identity.

110
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,880
Speaker 0: No one cares about it.

111
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,300
Speaker 0: It has no center.

112
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,680
Speaker 0: You barely know who the mayor is.

113
00:21:30,720 --> 00:22:36,360
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter because they're all being managed by... the state anyways and that's where they get most the funds seem to come from there more even from the from the taxes and so there's this like weird top-down thing that happens even in terms of our communities uh you know and so then it gets projected higher up uh you know america is a good example of one that's holding to some extent but in canada we you know trudeau said we're a post-national nation we're a nation of openness like our only value is inclusion uh and so it's like it's it's you know and it's very dangerous to the existence of the of the it's a very dangerous to the cohesion of our of our society right to move in that direction because you're right that we need those we need we need some kind of center to recognize who we are and how we participate but as we kind of deconstruct them uh you know possibly the purpose is again to put them higher right like you

114
00:22:36,820 --> 00:23:23,720
Speaker 1: versus definitely put them higher but i think it's worth basically sorry maybe i didn't convince this idea correctly i think even need is not strong enough it's not just the fact that we need these centers is the fact that we end up having them no matter what we think we know no matter what we think it is and in case of the you brought the idea for example of inclusion basically as you well know the human nature and the human creativity is very talented in creating idols out of literally anything so inclusion can become the idol around which you're trying to center your community but you think about this is just let's say a neutral value or as a sort of irrational thought processes you don't interact with it as with idol but it interacts with inclusion

115
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:33,460
Speaker 0: inclusion is literally like Etymologically, inclusion is a diabolical center because it is division.

116
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,620
Speaker 0: You can't make multiplicity the center.

117
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,800
Speaker 0: That's not possible.

118
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,900
Speaker 0: That is how you destroy something, is to say, I'm going to make the purpose of my car inclusion.

119
00:23:45,400 --> 00:24:23,020
Speaker 0: what you're gonna make the purpose of your car inclusion so it's like i'm gonna start like putting branches on it and like just adding stuff to it because i don't know what the purpose of it except for it to be inclusion that's nothing can function that way it's like uh it is it is a it is a destructive it is a destructive gesture but there is something obviously unconsciously there are probably there are still things that rise them that act as these weird Even that, it acts as an illusion of a center for a while, but ultimately it's leading to something else taking its place.

120
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,500
Speaker 0: I don't know what exactly, but something has to come and fill the vacuum because you can't have inclusion as an identity.

121
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,660
Speaker 0: It's a non-starter.

122
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,220
Speaker 1: Well, you will have basically the return of all gods.

123
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,020
Speaker 1: Because that, I think, is the ultimate trick, the second level trick.

124
00:24:39,680 --> 00:25:31,260
Speaker 1: like originally like it takes generally quite a while normally to explain but i think you will get it pretty quickly uh the trick is that we act let's say as if so what's the project of modernity and what is the project of enlightenment like is that what you put in your theological and teleological foundation the logos of a community and every community is structured around a logos like as you well know so it reflects the logos and it's moving towards the logos simultaneously and in this movement it becomes a community and the idea of enlightenment the idea of modernity the idea of hopes out of fear as we discussed because humans cannot be trusted basically so we don't put a real logos let's say what i mean by real logos if you talk to let's say an ancient tribe and you say that they have their animal totem or their ancestor totem they act to it as real.

125
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,560
Speaker 1: Even Zeus is real for an ancient Greek.

126
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,700
Speaker 1: Zeus is not an illusion.

127
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,020
Speaker 1: The mammoth head on a stick, it's not an illusion.

128
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,200
Speaker 1: It's a real... And the people are united about this thing as it's a real thing.

129
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,100
Speaker 1: It's an invisible thing, but it's a real thing.

130
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,360
Speaker 1: The idea of modernity is like, we are above this.

131
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,700
Speaker 1: It's a simple story.

132
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,140
Speaker 1: It's a dumb folk story tale.

133
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,500
Speaker 1: So we're putting... illusion, a simulacrum, a construct, a whole,

134
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,140
Speaker 1: etc.,

135
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,480
Speaker 1: etc.,

136
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:58,840
Speaker 1: etc.,

137
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,700
Speaker 1: which I call virtual.

138
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
Speaker 1: That's what I kind of mean.

139
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,140
Speaker 1: It's virtual in the sense that we created it and we understand that it is an illusion.

140
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,420
Speaker 1: We know that it is an illusion, but we expect it to act as if it's real.

141
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,640
Speaker 1: And that's why our understanding of this process is effectively wrong.

142
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,260
Speaker 1: And we are constantly surprised why it's not working.

143
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,120
Speaker 1: It's effectively a world which has cut itself from the heaven.

144
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 1: It's a world that deliberately cut itself from the heaven and creates a simulacrum of a heaven on the lower level.

145
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,820
Speaker 1: And all political projects of the last 400 years are this.

146
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,080
Speaker 1: All of them are just different variations of this.

147
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

148
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,240
Speaker 0: And it's one version of the existentialist nonsense, right?

149
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:58,340
Speaker 0: This idea that Sisyphus would just continue to roll his rock up the hill, even though he knows that it's going to come back down and he knows that there's nothing up there, right, that will bind him to a purpose.

150
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,680
Speaker 0: You know, that's not, that's not, how can I say this?

151
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,520
Speaker 0: Like, you actually, it runs out.

152
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
Speaker 0: right it runs

153
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:33,860
Speaker 1: out yeah and it has to speed up and it goes and it goes it's like basically a metaphor and i think this can be used as effectively as a directory it constantly needs more and remind that's why these projects are becoming shorter with each with each iteration if you notice that's a new big flash idea but at the same time that's why you can maybe never thought about it but i think that's actually the reason why let's say all And that's what I think is Gnosticism.

154
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 1: It's partially what Gnosticism is.

155
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,140
Speaker 1: This creation of this virtual realities and political Gnosticism.

156
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,880
Speaker 1: We know the secret, let's say, knowledge of ideal, of illusion, of dialectics, and we move it forward, etc.

157
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,740
Speaker 1: But that's why it's so important for us to control the speech.

158
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,040
Speaker 1: Because those who control the speech, those who control the discourse, they control the illusion.

159
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:32,900
Speaker 1: And it is very ironic because we expect... that we will seriously discuss and treat something which is we understand which is which doesn't really exist as if it is the most important and as if it's the most like acting in our life as this inclusion is just the biggest let's say the most uh visible example on you know on the modern level but it was before let's say class let's treat class as the most important oh let's treat race as the most important thing and it's it's going when it's going on but At the same time, it's only on the surface level.

160
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,980
Speaker 1: At least that's what I would say.

161
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,360
Speaker 0: What do you think is driving this?

162
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,580
Speaker 0: Because this is, I guess that's a good question, right?

163
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:50,840
Speaker 0: To say, you know, because one of the things you see in your article and you describe, I think very well, is in some ways, when you talk about Game of Thrones in the article, you all actually represent a character.

164
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 0: I haven't watched Game of Thrones, but one of the characters basically knows that this is an illusion.

165
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,580
Speaker 0: They know that this whole thing is a charade, but they do it nonetheless.

166
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,960
Speaker 1: I would say two answers.

167
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,340
Speaker 1: One is simple, another is more theological.

168
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Speaker 1: Simple answer is exactly philosophical, the fear.

169
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:27,760
Speaker 1: We need to understand that the foundation of... all political processes of modernity is fear, and Hobbes starts with fear, because that's why it's so important to understand the time where he's coming from.

170
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,040
Speaker 1: He's coming from a time of religious wars.

171
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:37,640
Speaker 1: That's a very uncomfortable truth about human nature, that when you believe in something with your whole heart, it can lead to a lot of violence.

172
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,460
Speaker 1: The notion of martyr is the same as a witness.

173
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,560
Speaker 1: Effectively, to witness an idea is to be ready to die for an idea.

174
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,840
Speaker 1: let's say, or to die in the pursuit of an idea.

175
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,220
Speaker 1: And it can lead to a very mess of things.

176
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,260
Speaker 1: Let's say 100 years of religious war in Europe, not good.

177
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,120
Speaker 1: So basically what I think it's partially started out of good intention and the good intention went well.

178
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,720
Speaker 1: If climbing towards the heaven is so painful and there is so much blood in the process, let's just subdued this thing.

179
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,160
Speaker 1: We are afraid of it.

180
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,600
Speaker 1: We are afraid of human nature.

181
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,440
Speaker 1: We generally are afraid of human nature because the king can be tyrannical.

182
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:36,980
Speaker 1: the father can be oppressive the mother can strangle his baby etc etc etc at the same time the political structure can result in genocide we are afraid of it so let's substitute it with something we think we can control so we cannot control a human heart but we think we can control an institution that's what i think is one half of the answer and that's kind of it's a good intention at least half of the answer

183
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:48,400
Speaker 0: and so but so safety would be your safety so basically we just need to preserve ourselves like just yeah

184
00:30:48,740 --> 00:31:42,340
Speaker 1: the comfort that's why it develops into what let's say sergey bulgakov it's one of the russian philosophers of the early 20th century because it's amor lotsy the love for a place so the love so let's cut let's close the heaven for ourselves let's focus on what is below and let's try to make it as nice as comfortable as safe as controllable as we possibly can like that one of the half of the answer that's what the good intention is but the uncomfortable truth and that's what i think people don't understand even when they're involved in these processes that what is really happening is uh even a bigger trick and to understand it i think you need to go a little bit to the art i know you're one of your favorite advances dirt poor robins and do you do you remember like their enchanted song they have this quote like and if we cannot raise the dead we're gonna raise hell instead

185
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,640
Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah

186
00:31:43,920 --> 00:32:26,000
Speaker 1: no but i think that if you're answering what is happening so that's is happening because not only visible things are real in political reality basically this logos around which the political community united and that's why i brought the example of a tribe they are not just the ideas that are embodied ideas let's say their principalities their demons their angels and they are acting as well and that's what i think is honestly what is playing out so thinking that you control this illusion that was that's why this image of pollen is so important so you think you are trying to create safety you think you are trying to create this mechanism But you are becoming the vessel for the spirits you can't even understand.

187
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,920
Speaker 0: Okay, I understand.

188
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:48,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically what you're saying, what you seem to be suggesting is that in the desire to be safe and secure and in control and to protect ourselves, which makes sense, in this desire to cover ourselves, to protect ourselves, then we become the vehicle for forces.

189
00:32:49,060 --> 00:33:06,260
Speaker 0: that that we don't even maybe even know we like we we we you know because there are other agencies acting on us like there are other patterns playing through us and then people don't even realize what's going on and that is that what you meant when you said the return of the pagan gods

190
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:22,680
Speaker 1: yes yes that's what i meant by the return of the pagan gods uh or demons etc because we lost that's what i like about let's say medieval political language they In their worldview, they do have place for this, and they understand that different forces can be placed.

191
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,240
Speaker 1: They, for example, can say something, well, we sinned, that's why this calamity has fallen upon us.

192
00:33:28,980 --> 00:34:05,660
Speaker 1: It's not a ridiculous phrase to say, and it is a very smart thing to say, because ultimately... a community is what it remembers and one can say it's a community is a reflection of an idol or a god of a principality or a logos it is oriented towards or it's prayed towards but we lost this language in a pursuit of safety because the pursuit of this higher original the pursuit of the higher purpose is kind of holds problem of uh waiting for the second it's kind of connected with the millennial reason if you go deep into the medieval history basically Long story short, I think people got tired of waiting for the second coming.

193
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,120
Speaker 1: They tried to build it with their own hands.

194
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,719
Speaker 1: In the process, they created a lot of mess.

195
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,699
Speaker 1: Like, you don't want to be in the 16th century Europe.

196
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,520
Speaker 1: It's really a lot of mess.

197
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,580
Speaker 1: And they started to desire safety.

198
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,540
Speaker 1: But the problem is, it's not just we who are in play.

199
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,280
Speaker 1: Basically, principalities have agency, ultimately.

200
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,179
Speaker 1: And I don't need to persuade you in this.

201
00:34:27,719 --> 00:35:04,780
Speaker 1: but uh like it is what is playing out uh uh in a political process but the modern political sense simply cannot talk about it nevertheless it is what is happening that's why it becomes very ironic as in the sense in that sense as the tribe is smarter than modern let's say uh president because tribe knows that when it prays to the god of its tribe it treats it as a god whereas when modern president talks about diversity equity inclusion or the green new deal they don't know that they are praying but they are and that's what i think the ultimate difference like if you want to put this way Yeah,

202
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,920
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah.

203
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,020
Speaker 0: And I'm trying to see the mechanism that you're describing.

204
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,920
Speaker 0: I mean, I kind of see it.

205
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,220
Speaker 0: It's a little bit of a, like, it's not totally clear to me, but let's play out it.

206
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Speaker 0: Let's give an example.

207
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,480
Speaker 0: Let me try to play out an example.

208
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,100
Speaker 0: Tell me what you think.

209
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:27,640
Speaker 0: And so this one is greed, for example, like money would be an easy one, which is that people say, oh, well, we need to be comfortable.

210
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,380
Speaker 0: We need to be safe.

211
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,060
Speaker 0: Like we want to basically make this right.

212
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:59,980
Speaker 0: uh and in order to do that without knowing it they unleash let's say a an action in the world of of uh an accelerate let's say economy in a way that you see happening and this kind of desire to accumulate money and to accumulate goods and to do all that and that becomes its own thing that now nobody can control like nobody who knows what the market is?

213
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,380
Speaker 0: Nobody knows what the market is.

214
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,820
Speaker 0: Nobody knows what the stock market is.

215
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,260
Speaker 0: We are completely subservient to it.

216
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,580
Speaker 0: And then someone announces on the news, well, the stock market crashed today.

217
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Speaker 0: And now all these consequences, people will lose their houses.

218
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,580
Speaker 0: All these things are going to happen because the stock market crashed.

219
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,480
Speaker 0: And nobody knows what the causalities are.

220
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:28,200
Speaker 0: We're completely... subservient to this thing that we nobody can control nobody can understand

221
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:49,940
Speaker 1: yeah even in this example it can be even more put even more direct terms let's say so we said that the increasing of human well-being is our also is the ultimate purpose of a state for example that's the phrase which is often heard so let's say the material well-being Well, and for this material well-being, we sacrifice literally, we bring sacrifices, like literal sacrifices.

222
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,940
Speaker 1: We sacrifice time, we sacrifice future, we sacrifice kids, quite literally.

223
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,120
Speaker 1: Let's say we sacrifice communities,

224
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,340
Speaker 1: etc.,

225
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,700
Speaker 1: etc.,

226
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,080
Speaker 1: etc.

227
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:08,180
Speaker 1: And we expect, like whether we admit it or not, that as a result of these sacrifices, we will receive this gold, increase of GDP, increase of this,

228
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,360
Speaker 1: etc.,

229
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,680
Speaker 1: etc.,

230
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,000
Speaker 1: etc.

231
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:44,960
Speaker 1: And the fun thing is that we treat... that we can talk about this in we are doing the things we can talk about what we are doing because think we are just following the numbers that's what i mean so and it but it is a very multi-tier like we can talk about quite easily right now because obviously you've been working on symbolism for so long but you know if you try to explain this pattern even though it's quite visible and it's not really hard to explain that when you're you're literally bringing sacrifices for the god of comfort you're literally doing it But you don't understand that you are doing it.

232
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,420
Speaker 1: You think you are doing just what a human economy should do, for example, or what irrational things should do.

233
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,860
Speaker 1: And that's what I mean.

234
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,380
Speaker 1: And that's happening on all different levels.

235
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,760
Speaker 1: Basically, I think it's an escapable thing.

236
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:04,840
Speaker 1: That's what I think is the most humbling to get for many people, because exactly this desire to control, this desire for safety.

237
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,480
Speaker 1: We wanted to create our own God.

238
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:53,740
Speaker 1: like effectively what le pi is what i'm sorry what let's say even in american declaration of independence this creator who endowed with certain unalienable rights he's kind of also not there he's not present okay he's in doubt and then he's gone so it's still kind of we are in control of these things but the truth is that these things you can never be in control of them truly and and that's the main part and that's what i think the bridge of this that's what kind of trying to achieve and hopeful to work on this discipline exactly to bring uh to bring the bridge between these two languages it can in a similar manner that you but do but in a slightly but in the different aspect because because there is a very uncomfortable truth i don't know if you noticed it on like um i don't know have you ever watched like horror movies like recently or something like this not

239
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,820
Speaker 0: recently i've watched more movies when i was younger but i don't think i don't remember the last movie

240
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:38,360
Speaker 1: i watched okay it's just there's a very interesting pattern falling there right now is that effectively the heavens are closed but the hell is right here and that's what i think is the ultimate uh like the demons the supernaturals the evil entities they're all there like that and there is a conflict of a rational mind with all of these entities that cannot get it like there's like psychiatrists tries to understand whether it's schizophrenia or not schizophrenia but uh in a way it is a similar pattern what is happening in our understanding of political realities because after we closed heavens, like as a metaphor, and tried to focus on what is imminent, we could not stay there.

241
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:47,680
Speaker 1: I mean, if you cannot, but we made ourselves open from the things below, and we cannot escape by becoming vessels on an individual and collective levels.

242
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,680
Speaker 1: That's what it is.

243
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,900
Speaker 0: No, I mean, that's totally right.

244
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,260
Speaker 0: I mean, René Guénon talked about this a long time ago in Reign of Quantity.

245
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,480
Speaker 0: He talks about, he says, he calls it fissures in the Great Wall.

246
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:35,420
Speaker 0: You know, he says that... the the the from the enlightenment and the scientific moment you know we have this idea that we we close ourselves off from anything any spiritual influence and the truth is that we did to some extent and it worked and that's why that's why there are no miracles that's why a lot of people you know they don't necessarily they can't kind of see they don't understand when they read medieval texts they don't even know what it's talking about because it's like it's it's referring to some other reality that we even don't have access to but like you said The cracks have been appearing now since at least World War II, I would say from World War II on, and the fishes in the wall are just spreading and spreading.

247
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:52,280
Speaker 0: I had never thought about the idea of that horror movies are in some ways like one of the manifestations of that, where it plays out in the story of the horror movie, which is exactly what you said, which is the story of the horror movie is the rational being against the demons.

248
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,200
Speaker 0: How can I believe in these things?

249
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,520
Speaker 0: This is impossible.

250
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,020
Speaker 0: It's still happening, even though I think it's not possible.

251
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,920
Speaker 0: All of these things.

252
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,900
Speaker 0: And there's no appeal to God, you know, in the...

253
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Speaker 1: The heaven is closed.

254
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,400
Speaker 1: That's kind of the main feeling.

255
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,380
Speaker 1: But it's necessarily closed because we forgot the most basic political, theological truth.

256
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:22,940
Speaker 1: And just to demonstrate... Because if you don't mind, if you have a little bit of time, I just want to demonstrate on a couple images what I mean by the ultimate reality.

257
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,560
Speaker 1: The basic thesis is whether you like it or not, what actually holds community together is a covenant.

258
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,520
Speaker 1: And covenant is religious by nature.

259
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,740
Speaker 1: And to show you the images, and then the question becomes what holds the covenant.

260
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:52,020
Speaker 1: And actually there are a lot of imagery which quite well shows that... even though we don't know this our ancestors did it like here is for example a sculpture like of an icon can you see well

261
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,040
Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah i know that that type

262
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:14,460
Speaker 1: but if you notice this very interesting idea so that's the same nicholas of mojaisk like it's a like it's a sculpt originally sculpture as a result of an icon version and what is interesting here is that he holds the city like it's literally written right here that it's a city of mojaisk Let's say so.

263
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:21,180
Speaker 1: But that's a very visible reflection of what the nature of political community is.

264
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,060
Speaker 1: It's not just about church.

265
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,120
Speaker 1: In any political community, there is this religious element.

266
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,860
Speaker 1: And the saint holds the city.

267
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,860
Speaker 1: The principality holds the city.

268
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:40,580
Speaker 1: Or if you want to go, let's say, basically, the derivative from it would be a phrase, an idea holds the city.

269
00:42:40,700 --> 00:44:28,380
Speaker 1: But that, I think, is very... kind of try to bring this like to pretend to be scientific and not still going to the crux of it because then the reasonable question was an idea whose idea is holding cow it's false etc etc etc whereas like you can see in this imagery that like it's pretty clear that the principality the logos was holding the unity together and once you remove this once once you stop this idea of a city which is you see is the border so there is a border there is a unity within the border and it's but it's not holding itself by itself it's effectively still hold by something external and you can see it's an imagery and the ultimate imagery of it i would say is a very interesting idea like you know that uh the image of pantocrator like the is a cry the christ which holds things together well in uh there is a story which i cannot actually show you the image because it was destroyed in world war ii but there was a story in the city of novgorod like big on the most ancient Russian cities and there were artists were painting this image on the tallest part of the cathedral and no matter how hard they tried to do instead of a blessing gesture the hand of the Lord was always kind of in a holding position it was like as if it holds things like and uh according to the legend that there was after like four attempts there was a voice from above that stop doing it i am holding this city like and if you open my hands then exactly the city will disappear like another example is like this image of um from like usgania cathedrals that let's see it's a hand that holds exactly people, the people, it's the hands that hold the people.

270
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:37,360
Speaker 1: And in a way, the trick of modernity was to imagine we don't need this hand, that we can create our own hands that hold this hand.

271
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,520
Speaker 1: But what happened as a result?

272
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:48,240
Speaker 1: Well, now we're still being held, but first not by this hand, by other hands, but the hands we can control.

273
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,160
Speaker 1: we think we control, but are in fact controlling us.

274
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:04,560
Speaker 1: And I think it's very important to start talking about these processes on this level, because otherwise, as you said in your very opening statement, there is no interest in talking about them at all.

275
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:12,600
Speaker 1: There is no interest in talking about he said what, you said what, what is happening, this flash thing happened there, this other thing happened there.

276
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,500
Speaker 1: I don't know if you could.

277
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,820
Speaker 0: No, I think you're right.

278
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,400
Speaker 0: You know, and there are many other images we could have used.

279
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,880
Speaker 0: The image of the veil, protective veil of the Mother of God is a great image.

280
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:33,260
Speaker 0: You know, you see that in the Western medieval age, middle age, you see also images of the Mother of God with like, in her cloak, she has all these people, kind of like the hand.

281
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,160
Speaker 0: You know, this idea that we are held together, you know, it makes sense.

282
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:49,700
Speaker 0: And like you said, if we don't know what is holding us and what is driving us, then it's going to be... it's going to be forces that we don't we don't even understand

283
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:12,380
Speaker 1: like it's an example of what you are talking about like that's what you were talking about let's say the mother of god like and exactly you see the multiplicities different multiplicities it's a relatively new russian icon but it's based on all of these different different versions of mother of god from different let's say localities there is an image of a land but it is united with what like let's say covers it and

284
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,640
Speaker 0: basically

285
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:29,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think we, like, this kind of comes to us as, like, symbolists, or I'll say even orthodox, like, basically my big discovery in, like, first, so I started, let's say, studying politics as a just traditional political scientist,

286
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,420
Speaker 1: etc.,

287
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:29,720
Speaker 1: etc.,

288
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,800
Speaker 1: and truth be told, I eventually found that it's just simply useless in many ways.

289
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:48,440
Speaker 1: It's not answering the real questions, it's not showing what's happening, and then I discovered, like, basically this more traditional and then symbolic way of understanding the very same processes.

290
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
Speaker 1: But then we have bigger things right now, which we are in a very interesting position.

291
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,160
Speaker 1: These two things kind of exist in separate realities.

292
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,380
Speaker 1: We don't really, you know, connect them.

293
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,200
Speaker 1: And that's why my question, the first question was like whether you not want to do, like where comes this desire not to connect?

294
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:39,840
Speaker 1: like because we want to separate us from this realities in a way like we want to separate us from this conversation but i think it's inevitable first that it's impossible because we're still living within these communities yeah and secondly if like basically if you don't provide an accurate account of something an accurate account will be provided i don't know like if you don't it's the same the problem of a culture war which you fight so much if you don't participate in a culture the culture will effectively participate in you yeah

295
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:57,560
Speaker 0: well that's i mean i think that that's the way to to i think that's the best way to understand it uh is is to how can i say this right It's to help rebuild the real communities.

296
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,540
Speaker 0: That seems to be the only thing we can do.

297
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,220
Speaker 0: And that starts with yourself and it starts with your own surrounding.

298
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,480
Speaker 0: It starts with your own vices and your own sins.

299
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,800
Speaker 0: And then it starts with your family.

300
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,020
Speaker 0: Like I said, your parish, the things that are around you.

301
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,240
Speaker 0: To me, that is in some ways the only way to go.

302
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,120
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not saying you shouldn't be involved in the politics of your country.

303
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:33,280
Speaker 0: When it was COVID, I was making a lot more noise about politics because it was in my house and in my life and it was my leaders and it was my country.

304
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,220
Speaker 0: And it wasn't like Donald Trump and Harris or it wasn't a war in the Middle East or it wasn't a war in Eastern Europe.

305
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,340
Speaker 0: It was something that was happening here.

306
00:48:42,940 --> 00:49:27,080
Speaker 0: And so I was far more vocal and not only vocal, but... organized on the street level right it's like i did go to the protest i did i i also we had our own we reorganized our own network of associations in order to be able to to thrive through the the crisis and so i'm not against i'm not against politics i'm just i think i'm wary of the the illusion that getting involved in political discourse, especially on the Internet, that it does anything except make the go forward.

307
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,420
Speaker 1: You're absolutely correct.

308
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,240
Speaker 1: I absolutely agree with you.

309
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,620
Speaker 1: And what I mean by involvement and in terms of basically, I like that your answer was about what you can do.

310
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,560
Speaker 1: So immediately put into category of action, which is the key element.

311
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,440
Speaker 1: I just put that to this.

312
00:49:43,020 --> 00:50:13,320
Speaker 1: range of advices i think it's very important to as you know in the genesis like basically one of the main human uh let's say uh power power of adam is the power to give names and that's what i think is where like what i mean by political activity i don't mean by political activity you know participate what is expected participation talking about taxes or talking about other things i think what I mean, when I talk about the building the bridge between these two realities, it's just naming what the things are happening.

313
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:20,840
Speaker 1: Let's say it's good to be... I think in order to rebuild communities, we need to just be clear what community is.

314
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,580
Speaker 1: We don't even talk about that community is a religious phenomenon.

315
00:50:25,100 --> 00:51:23,960
Speaker 1: We still think that any community and political community is such an... you can argue that as soon as you end up a community it has a political side to it like sorry a city has a political side to it even a district had like even a community or a village has a political side to it and just to be even at least to be capable of withstanding these different like elements which is coming from the outside you need to understand what you are and for this you need a language and for this you need a way to show to describe to just name the things the way they are because otherwise it's hard to explain let's say what is exactly your what is exactly your position let's say was an idea of uh inclusion let's say why are you exactly opposing and we go into these very lengthy details about let's say well that's a one rational argument for it well that's as a philosophy let's say biological arguments etc whereas you can say well i just don't watch it don't want to worship this idol And I don't think that's what unites me.

316
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,940
Speaker 1: And since it's the idol which is proposed to be put in the center of my community, I oppose to it.

317
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,400
Speaker 1: That's what I mean by it.

318
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:37,200
Speaker 1: Like, I just mean, I think building... And this can be done, I think, ultimately, first in, like, practicing it.

319
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Speaker 1: Like, truth be told, it's kind of the same of acting.

320
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,120
Speaker 1: That's what I'm trying to do.

321
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,680
Speaker 1: Like, mostly in Russian, but that's what I'm trying to do.

322
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:51,120
Speaker 1: When I talk about the different processes, I'm trying to underlie, like, different basic patterns which are happening, like... Why people are doing these irrational things?

323
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,740
Speaker 1: Well, because that's what is happening.

324
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,380
Speaker 0: I also want to be careful.

325
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:05,300
Speaker 0: I want to be careful that people don't think that I'm saying that there's no room for political involvement.

326
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,680
Speaker 0: Because one of the things, too, is that different people play different roles.

327
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,040
Speaker 0: We all kind of have different roles and different strengths and different capacities in this world.

328
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:29,560
Speaker 0: I think that my the role that I can play is more in terms of story and in terms of helping people understand the basic structures and helping them understand this question of participation.

329
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:37,800
Speaker 0: But, you know, I I think that downstream from that, there will be legislation like there has to be there will be people proposing laws.

330
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,080
Speaker 0: There will be people, you know.

331
00:52:40,920 --> 00:53:00,400
Speaker 0: redefining, you know, levels of authority and power and understanding what those powers are related to our own, you know, like when I talk about a kind of fractal system of identity and authority, this is something that can have real consequences in the world and can reform the way that bonds exist.

332
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,880
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

333
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,880
Speaker 0: But I think that that's the work that has to be done first.

334
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,100
Speaker 0: And while that's happening, I'm also not, it's like, while that's happening, I'm also grateful.

335
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,200
Speaker 0: for anybody who's able to slow the madness around.

336
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:22,400
Speaker 0: It's like when I watch Jordan Peterson or even people that don't maybe like me that much.

337
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:31,360
Speaker 0: If I watch James Lindsay just nonstop onslaught to stop the communists from coming back, I'm like, okay, that's great.

338
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,240
Speaker 0: We also need that because there's also the immediacy of the problem.

339
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,780
Speaker 0: But I can't myself.

340
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:45,320
Speaker 1: oh i can tell you you are doing it actually no no but i

341
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:54,680
Speaker 0: feel like i'm getting sucked into an into a vortex of you know yeah this like spinning thing that doesn't have doesn't totally

342
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:59,640
Speaker 1: well i i think here i can actually cheer you up or maybe it won't be that cheerful because knowingly or unknowingly i think you are involved into these processes and even bigger on the most on the highest level because in a real hierarchy of power and like i don't have time to talk too much about it the ultimate power is a power of a story the power of idea the power is the story centricity so by creating an alternative story so more like reviving the true stories like it is a political action like i don't know that's that's why i mentioned like because when the true story is revived even let's say the revival of symbolical thinking as such like the reviving of this images of images of unity the reviving of your the image of the mountain like you have a political impact like that's what i think is inescapable and we just need to understand what we are involved with like basically whenever you are touching the um issues of meaning, you are making a political action.

343
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:09,820
Speaker 1: And that's why, for example, there was this original conflict between Christianity and the Roman Empire, because even Christians thought that they were not involved in a political activity.

344
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,900
Speaker 1: The Roman Empire thought very well that they were.

345
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,700
Speaker 1: By creating the complete alternative system of meaning, willingly or not, you are participating into it.

346
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,120
Speaker 1: And I think it's a very cool thing to be aware of, in a good way.

347
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,520
Speaker 1: On the most basic way.

348
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,100
Speaker 1: So effectively, you're just keeping the whole boring part and just going to the crux of it.

349
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,080
Speaker 0: No, I mean, I agree.

350
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:42,000
Speaker 0: I would say... Yeah, I would say that there are definitely political implications to the things that I'm talking about and doing.

351
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,040
Speaker 0: But I ultimately let other people work that out.

352
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,720
Speaker 0: In my particular... case and also work it out more locally in their own in their own uh in their own sphere

353
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Speaker 1: uh absolutely no it's just uh i think that's exactly the trick like so what we the kind of our real pro like people because people really ask what we can be done right now etc etc and i think it can be done on unfortunately kind of skipping the whole thing we've been holding the most important for the last let's say 400 years this whole middle part, the part of the state, the part of administrative,

354
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:18,900
Speaker 1: etc.,

355
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:19,240
Speaker 1: etc.

356
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:33,000
Speaker 1: It can be done on the one side, on the power of communities, what you mentioned, yourself, family, local elements, and at the same time on the highest level, which is the power of words, the power of ideas, the power of meetings.

357
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,100
Speaker 1: And only then there can be some connection involved through this.

358
00:56:37,740 --> 00:57:14,820
Speaker 1: Because the middle part, right now we... cannot even talk about it and i think that's what kind of i mean the most we cannot even talk about what is happening really like you do occasionally like and we can do occasionally but realistically on the most level people don't understand that's what people don't understand and we're not there yet to explain that for example the way people treat even let's say presidential candidates or political candidates are idyllic they do treat them they treat them as like oh that's the idol who will save this process or this side up and it's inevitable because we have no other unit we don't have the hands of all things together so we have we are in an endless capable processes of creating them

359
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:23,180
Speaker 0: yeah it's funny it's actually quite it's funny to watch it happen like it's like in my country it's even funnier because

360
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,080
Speaker 1: at least

361
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:31,960
Speaker 0: the president can have some kind of like pretension of being a central spoke that kind of holds things together.

362
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:49,520
Speaker 0: But in a prime minister, like in Canada, you know, we treat our prime minister like the president, even though our prime minister is the head of a, is an elected seat in the head of a government and is, you know, and could be kicked out of his own party at any time that they vote against him.

363
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,220
Speaker 0: But we still treat him like a little king because it's like we just.

364
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:04,520
Speaker 0: what you know we like you said it's just it's just inevitable and if people were more aware of it then they would do it more reasonably than

365
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:27,180
Speaker 1: and chiller and honestly chiller away yeah and that's i think that's uh one of the big reasons of where the whole neurosis neurotization of the whole political processes is coming from because what people actually the actual desire of people in there will say political figures and other things is way different from what they think the desire is.

366
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,840
Speaker 1: So they want the unity, they want a god to worship, but they say they want, I don't know, free healthcare.

367
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,100
Speaker 1: And it's not the same.

368
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

369
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,580
Speaker 1: That's so right.

370
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's so right.

371
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,840
Speaker 0: And then it's also this like, how can I say this?

372
00:58:42,260 --> 00:59:35,860
Speaker 0: It's also this idea that if the wrong president, let's say the wrong president is elected, if the wrong prime minister is elected, then we're gonna live in hell like it's all gonna fall apart like everything is finished because everything just depends on this like little this this this this guy and and like you said if you ask someone if they believe that they would say of course i don't believe that but they act everybody acts as if that's the that's the case um you know and when in fact like you like you intimated at the outset there are real principalities that are moving these things along and those are are the let's say the the gods that are kind of moving the the system are invisible to most like we worship them without totally knowing it or we worship through these proxies and we can't see what it is that is being that is managing us

373
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:52,240
Speaker 1: oh yeah absolutely like and well sometimes we even say it like i don't know if you i mean i know you're following it but it's exactly i think the It's my favorite of your videos is when you, for example, take some event and you show the symbolism of this event, which pretends not to be symbolic at all.

374
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,640
Speaker 1: You can see in Paris Olympics, that was just, sorry, the principalities are literally there.

375
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,840
Speaker 1: Or you can see on all of these, let's say, environmental meetings when they almost literally nowadays worship Geyer.

376
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,660
Speaker 1: Like, almost literally.

377
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,680
Speaker 1: And sometimes literally.

378
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:30,180
Speaker 1: and you pretend that it's neutral it's not religious but it's like it's just think and that's what i mean and everybody else kind of have to but that's what i think i think the one of the main reasons people are participating in these games is because they don't know they don't have to and they don't have a language not to have to and that's what i mean like you can't just still

379
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:37,840
Speaker 0: have an alternative you don't have something to work the truly worship that is worthy of their worship you know and that's one

380
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,180
Speaker 1: of

381
01:00:38,240 --> 01:01:13,420
Speaker 0: the things that that that can help is that if you know what the source of reality is and you understand the nature well you don't understand it but you you direct your attention to the to the highest aspect you know to the highest transcendent truth then then at least you know like how you're orienting yourself but every like you said everybody needs that and because they they deny it at the outset they end up they end up grasping at all these different principalities that just appear and disappear.

382
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,260
Speaker 1: And then you can actually ask the important question.

383
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:24,860
Speaker 1: If we have to be united through the worship of a principality, let's maybe be careful about which one we are worshiping.

384
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,320
Speaker 1: Let's choose at least the real one.

385
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,340
Speaker 1: Let's not choose the illusionary one.

386
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's not choose a parasite, something that is actually feeding on you in order to maintain its existence.

387
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,500
Speaker 1: Because the principles are surreal.

388
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:50,220
Speaker 1: For example, as we mentioned, the way we treat so many different things like progress, especially progress and economy, that's kind of the two main things.

389
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,760
Speaker 1: Progress is the best one.

390
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,200
Speaker 0: What the hell?

391
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,140
Speaker 0: What is this progress you're talking about?

392
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:03,380
Speaker 0: no i open progress is what people worship there's actually no telos it's like it's it's something like inclusion it's like

393
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:43,620
Speaker 1: well there is phallus it's exactly the telethon receiving gold and like effectively it's sorry i know i i mean it won't sound crazy it's literally not different from kerfa genius worship in zamora barton is literally exactly the same and i actually think i wouldn't be surprised if progress and moloch has one of the same name because you bring your future you know in the view of your firstborn and there are like slaves and all of the different things and you get the biggest material prosperity ever seen on a planet by that time i don't see much difference in the ways that people treat progress i'm sorry and they also expect immortality from it just a little bit like now we just also expect immortality that's

394
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:59,420
Speaker 0: an interesting idea even like the idea The idea of credit, because I've been trying to understand credit for years, but I just had an insight when you were talking about it, that credit is something like sacrificing your children.

395
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,260
Speaker 0: It really is.

396
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,440
Speaker 0: I can't believe I never thought about that.

397
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,260
Speaker 0: Because what you're basically saying is, I am going to sacrifice the future for now.

398
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,600
Speaker 0: And so I'm willing to sacrifice my children's life.

399
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,120
Speaker 0: in order to get what i need what i need right now

400
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:17,680
Speaker 1: huh

401
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:39,020
Speaker 0: yeah that's that's such a great it's such a simple insight and i never how is it that i've never seen that you know i've said it similar to that like i've talked about the idea of of but i've never thought of it really as a kind of moloch uh sacrifice or like the idea of the sacrifice of the of your children

402
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,160
Speaker 1: because i talked

403
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,440
Speaker 0: about it in terms of abortion like because abortion is Clearly that, right?

404
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,100
Speaker 0: It's like a woman says, I have this child in me, I'm going to kill it, and then my life will be better.

405
01:03:50,220 --> 01:04:01,080
Speaker 0: It's basically saying, I want something now, and this future thing that's going to cause me all this trouble, I want to... But credit is different, but it's something like that.

406
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,000
Speaker 1: Credit is a similar treat.

407
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,020
Speaker 1: It's the same pattern, just playing out differently.

408
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:14,060
Speaker 1: If you're talking about... And even let's not go into the same... On a lighter level than abortion, the pattern is still the same.

409
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:21,500
Speaker 1: That's why I think Moloch is one of the main bots of this kind of, at least capitalist monarchy, or like the capitalist structure.

410
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:32,400
Speaker 1: Because when a person is saying, okay, I will sacrifice my family, or let's say nowadays a woman says, I will sacrifice my family for a career, and then in 20 years I will maybe come back to it.

411
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,260
Speaker 1: And the thing is the pattern, you notice that this thing which is sacrifice is given.

412
01:04:38,760 --> 01:05:05,160
Speaker 1: it is fulfilling a certain part of a deal it is bringing material prosperity just in the end it will trick you as any demon will but in a part it brings you the prosperity let's say you want more money in your 20s you will get more money in your 20s it's the same it's literally the same so you you want your money you will get your money are you dampering your future yes but that's the part of a deal

413
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love it.

414
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,120
Speaker 0: I love it.

415
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,560
Speaker 0: I'm seeing a lot of things that make sense.

416
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:18,940
Speaker 0: I also hadn't thought about the idea of people having children later in life as something like that as well.

417
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,680
Speaker 0: It's like I want my youth for myself.

418
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:46,800
Speaker 0: right instead of for others instead of giving my youth to giving my youth to my children right because usually that was the normal way to go which is that you want to have kids uh you want to have kids and your you know your money and your wealth is spent on your on your kids that's like a normal thing but now there's this weird thing uh super interesting definitely stuff to think about

419
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:58,920
Speaker 1: because exactly we created this force let's say we created the world let's say between symbolical and theological reality and let's say economical, political and like sociological reality.

420
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:06,080
Speaker 1: But it is a very modern understanding and my article was in a way to show it's just it's very short and like there is much more to say.

421
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,360
Speaker 1: But it was a conscious effort to kind of separate these things.

422
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:19,120
Speaker 1: But the problem is by nature they are inseparable because as you well know it's a human nature according to the fathers that we have like this desire for the immanent.

423
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,340
Speaker 1: We have this let's say horizontal desire.

424
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,680
Speaker 1: but we also have this vertical desire.

425
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,260
Speaker 1: And we are inescapable of this pattern no matter how much we try.

426
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:35,080
Speaker 1: But nowadays we just spend like generations and hundreds of years in this separate state.

427
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,900
Speaker 1: So on a verity level, we have this border and we just don't connect the dots.

428
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:43,440
Speaker 1: But once you connect them, it kind of becomes clear what is happening and why it is happening.

429
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,000
Speaker 1: Like the question what to do, you already answered.

430
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,860
Speaker 1: But one thing is to understand.

431
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,300
Speaker 1: And that's what I think is like.

432
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,740
Speaker 0: yeah it makes a lot of sense yeah it makes sense listen uh yeah i know

433
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,360
Speaker 1: so sorry uh

434
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,200
Speaker 0: but this is great great conversation i really appreciate it

435
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:07,600
Speaker 1: well then thank you for your time uh thank you for your time i hope there will be more conversations uh between us to come and
