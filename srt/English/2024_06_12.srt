1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:38,740
Speaker 0: hello dear friends uh i'm excited to welcome you to the second part of a conversation between me and richard rowland which is a direct continuation of the conversation we had a month ago we talked about unity and multiplicity we talked about pentecost we talked about tower of babel we talked about the leviathan it was a fascinating conversation and i invite you all to come and listen to it and today as promised we are having a part two uh which once again i will i'm excited to have welcome richard

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,740
Speaker 1: i'm it's great to be back christos

3
00:00:43,480 --> 00:01:09,180
Speaker 0: was crazy uh yeah so we're recording it afterista naturally and actually that's a great transition point because last time you promised that we will start our second conversation uh talking about the saint thomas the twin and uh we celebrated his feast a week ago not this sunday but the previous sunday and yeah all on you basically so not to waste time let's go

4
00:01:09,780 --> 00:06:14,340
Speaker 1: yeah so saint thomas is is interesting because uh he of all of the missionaries of the early church you can sort of argue that he's the one that goes the farthest now there are certain apostles who seem to be you could say like apostles to the edge there are apostles who go to the edge of the world so uh saint andrew just as a quick example is a very i mean a very famous example of the saint andrew there are uh like medieval illustrations of saint andrew like preaching to the dog-headed men you know uh and uh and so on right so um uh but saint thomas is another one of those sort of apostles to the edge or like the apostle to the extreme edge of the world um the the at the uma oh and uh prophet modellги Breth by the nsjth to the extreme edge of the world you can see Сnt thomas on the right he know this very sort of in Philadelphia a不能 было the it was up in the best part of ... you know like a 20 50 10 0 you know not from all of the United States but then there's uh there are, but I said aberrantly the bestburgban to the some of the early missionary workings of saint thomas are uh they're recorded in um in a in a they're recorded in an ancient christian apocryphal document which uh sometimes called acts of thomas and it is um sometimes considered problematic there are definitely uh like many of these these really old apocryphal writings there are different redactions out there and some of them are a little gnostic and of course there's also very gnostic redactions of the gospel of thomas right uh one sort of famous example uh but um but but the story itself the core story itself is is has been received in in the tradition and so one of the things we were talking about was saint thomas uh the twin right he's called thomas didymus in the gospels so the sort of the question then is like well whose twin is he right whose twin is he and uh it's funny because when i was in like evangelical bible college and things like this they would sort of speculate oh he must have just had a twin right he just had a twin and maybe that's why he's not at the upper room maybe he's he's not there uh you know because he's going to check on his his brother or something like that but the thing is all of the all of the apostles they had family that they could have been checking on but they're not they're gathered in the upper room we are told for fear of the jews right they they're afraid well jesus just got crucified it's it's simple to understand jesus was just crucified and now uh now they're going to be uh they're afraid that they're next right so the tradition of the church and uh this is a very old very early tradition in our uh in the orthodox church and in church history in general the tradition of the church is that saint saint thomas was christ's twin they actually he looked so much like christ that you would sort of mistake them for each other and this is why the apostles start to give him the nickname as the twin right to look like so this is then kind of the sort of the theme of the writing the apocryphal apocryphal writings around thomas and around his um his travels and his missionary journey so as i think most people are aware saint thomas uh makes it to all the way to india where he founds uh several early christian communities in fact christian communities in india now uh orthodox evangelical roman catholic all across the spectrum uh very often refer to themselves as as saint thomas christians because of this so he makes it out to india and while he's out there in india um there's sort of very famous stories of the things that he does right famous stories of the things that he does and a lot of them hinge on the fact that he looks like christ right and so in some way like he is christ or sort of christ double um and again some people like make a big deal about this and say it's sort of gnostic where thomas is like the earthly christ and and then christ is the heavenly christ or something like this but i think it's uh i think there's something deeper going on there um and it has to do with the way that the mission of the church goes to the ends of the earth which is what pentecost is about so the story goes something like when uh saint thomas is um when he's at the uh you know it's after pentecost and the disciples are beginning to kind of go to the different places around the world and uh christ actually sells thomas into slavery uh because god tells thomas to go to i know it's weird uh god tells thomas to go to india tells him to go to india right and uh thomas is like well how am i supposed to get there right so this is it christ says don't worry about it come down to the docks and we'll find some a passage so they get down to the docks and christ actually sells saint thomas to a slave trader and the slave trader is the one who gets him to india so then you know thomas has this whole journey this whole trip and he finally gets to india and he gets sold to one of the kings there of one of the of one of the tribes in india and uh and uh saint thomas uh basically becomes like so so there's that kind of um let's say like an overlap or a um

5
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,660
Speaker 0: parallel to both joseph kinda and daniel

6
00:06:18,700 --> 00:10:35,720
Speaker 1: exactly yeah yeah so it's an overlap of uh uh i'm trying to remember the word for this now um uh polyvalence let's say like a polyvalence between uh between joseph and christ and thomas right because joseph is also a type of christ where he's actually one of the main ones in the old testament certainly that's how the church father saw it right so in the same way joseph is sold into slavery and then rises to this high position of trust that's what thomas does as well and and there are other parallels as well so when thomas gets to india he uh rises to this this high position of trust and uh this king who's about to go away for a long time tells him tells him uh hey why don't you uh uh why don't you uh uh you know i'm gonna be gone for a long time while i'm gone why don't you build me a palace and uh thomas says yeah no problem i'll take care of it um i'm just gonna need money for materials and all these different things and so the king goes away on a journey and uh he writes you know a few months later he writes back to thomas and he says hey how's how's my new palace coming along he says it's going pretty well and he's like oh yeah i'm gonna be gone for a long time well your majesty i just need a little more money for building materials and he says okay well you can have this this money and then writes him again says how are things going he says oh it's going fine but i need money for the roof and i need money for these pillars i need money for the throne and like all these different things right so the king keeps authorizing more and more money and finally many years later he comes back he comes back and uh he comes back and finds that there's been no palace built at all and he starts asking the other men of the court about this thomas and they basically say no thomas has been giving all your money away to the poor well the king gets really mad and by uh some version of the story has thomas you know thrown in prison and uh and then in some versions of the story the king like dies that night or sometimes it's like his brother that dies uh but basically i usually it's his brother dies um and is and is sort of resurrected by saint thomas but like while his his after his brother had died uh he's he's being you know taken through the afterlife and being shown you know in heaven like all these great mansions and he looks over at one massive really beautiful mansion like this amazing gorgeous palace with the columns and the throne and the roof and like all these things he says man whose place is that and uh you know whoever's guiding him through the afterlife says well that's your brother you know that's your that's for your brother that thomas built that for him right and uh so then he you know kind of wakes up sometimes the king has a dream sometimes his brother dies and is raised and anyway the point is that this causes the king to like realize actually where his priorities are and he converts and he becomes a citizen of the heavenly kingdom um this is just kind of one example uh the other interesting thing about thomas is kind of just a recurring trope of the way that he's always late to things uh so famously in the story of the dormition of the mother of god sometimes people call the feats of the assumption all of the apostles are brought by the holy spirit from the four corners of the world all the different places and the four corners of the world that they've been ministering and they're there at present at the at the at the repose of the mother of god uh except for saint thomas who's still in india and so uh after her burial you know uh there um uh as her soul is departing this life and ascending up in heaven uh saint thomas shows up right then and he says where are you going oh holy one you know like you know i just got here where are you leaving and and uh so famously in one story that's when she bestows her girdle upon him as a sort of like a parting gift so that he won't be like without consolation so um so there's a lot of interesting things going on with thomas uh he's uh someday when i have some more time to think about it i would like to uh kind of look at the missionary journeys and the kind of the symbolism of each of the apostles and the ways that different early christian communities tie themselves to one particular apostle obviously antioch and rome both famously very attached to saints peter and paul uh saint andrew also though is one that really gets around obviously for constantinople he's an important saint for the the slavic peoples he's an important saint but also

7
00:10:36,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Speaker 0: do you know what ah interesting because i just wanted to mention about saint andrew according to russian orthodox tradition especially you know like older orthodox tradition obviously it went up the dnipa river and that's more or less people know that's why he went let's say to the modern kiev area and that's where people go to the modern kiev area and that's where people go to the modern kiev area and that's where people mostly know the story today but actually according to the old tradition it came even way further north it came as far north as uh like the balan monasteries it's kind of it's it's very it's it's north let me put it this way it's yeah it's to the north of smorgasbord so he went up until that point and founded this first let's say proto-monastic communities and that's how tradition goes so that's actually the community is way older and that's you mentioned that he is from the scots it's also i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know most of the north in a way so the whole kind of the whole northern region

8
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:39,200
Speaker 1: places that are kind of on the extreme edge like it's it's difficult to imagine being more on the edge of the world than somewhere like the lam or scotland right yeah yeah

9
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:55,800
Speaker 0: yeah and if and you know even nowadays so this uh andrew cross it's on a it's on a flag of russian navy for example and even now and still kind of keeps on with the part of this tradition so it's interesting how this original tradition is still in some state symbols even until now

10
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:38,500
Speaker 1: that's right yeah same thing i mean obviously saint andrew's cross is the is the cross of the the kingdom of scotland and it's it's interesting um so what i would like to do one day is to kind of like look at each of the apostles and kind of where they ministered and the way that these early communities kind of identified with them tied themselves but then you have other places that uh where the patronage of us of one of the apostles becomes really important a long time after i was so so i mean just for instance the the importance of saint mark in venice right obviously saint mark uh didn't die in venice he died in alexandria but at some point they brought his relics back to venice and they're like oh saint mark he's our patron now along with all this other stuff we looted from alexandria but

11
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,920
Speaker 0: that's a very questionable story how he ended

12
00:12:40,980 --> 00:15:42,580
Speaker 1: up yes yes yes yeah but i mean also like i'll i'll just put it this way a lot of a lot of relics ended up in venice suspiciously so but uh but yeah i think that uh so to kind of tie that back into pentecost right one of the the elements of the icon of the pentecost right that you'll see is i wish i had an icon of pentecost in here um i've got one somewhere else in the house but in an icon of pentecost you'll very often see this sort of door that's got a black background and then there's a figure standing in the door and uh jonathan pacho has done a video about this a really long time ago it's like i think one of his first videos that was really big um but uh in in uh very old uh icons like sometimes you have to see a dog-headed figure in that door like the um but then in um in modern icons usually it's sort of depicted as like an old man with a crown and then he's holding in his uh like a sort of a a towel or something or a tray sometimes and it's got all these scrolls on it right and then around this guy's head will be the word cosmos which is his name right so this is the this is a like a anthropomorphic representation of the cosmos and the scrolls that he's holding are the are the words of the apostles in other words the gospel right and this is a you could say it's like a visual representation of their sound has gone out into all the the earth and their sayings to the ends of the cosmos right which is a line from the psalms which is originally about the stars and planets but which the church applies to the the apostles actually the new testament also applies it to the apostles right which is the church obviously but but uh uh you know for instance that's the if you're if you're if you're you go to church on one of the feasts of the holy apostles uh that will be the procune on their sound has gone out into all the earth and their sayings to the ends of the cosmos right so anyway that the point of point of all that is to say that um uh these these saints saints like saint andrew and saints like saint thomas in particular are very closely connected to all that and and again i'm just very interested in this idea is thomas is sort of being the twin of christ uh but then like you know sold into slavery by him you know for this missionary work and it's i mean if you think about that you can take this sort of the gnostic associations out of it and say uh the focus is on the way that uh christ who is the king makes himself a slave to the nations right and you can and this is even tied into the way that the christian faith manifests you know to kind of back around to talking about um to talking about well this has to do with like nationhood and all these different things the way the christian faith manifests in different times and places so that there can be such a thing as russian orthodoxy or uh or you know even even antiochian

13
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,100
Speaker 0: orthodoxy syrian orthodoxy

14
00:15:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Speaker 1: an example we really like to use here in the states is uh the uh the way that the orthodox faith was brought to the illusion islanders in alaska um and because they weren't uh they weren't forced into the faith and actually many of them came to the faith despite the fact that so many russians were taking advantage of them right you know like this like the fur traders and and so on like you know people treating them really really poorly and of course that is why the you know that's why saint herman and the other missionaries that's why they came to look after these people and it was the the testimony of holiness that these men had especially saint herman living among them um and and you know them being able to see that this is a holy right and so they came into the faith they weren't forced into it but they came into it in this organic way and in this way that allowed them to preserve their sort of distinct cultural identities while also being orthodox and also bringing in russian things right because that's the way the faith came to them and um you know this is an ongoing conversation that we seem to be constantly having in the orthodox church in north america where uh there are people especially who are converts converts from evangelicalism or from other some other western form of christianity and there's sometimes a lot of anxiety there's a lot of anxiety about like okay well when are we going to get like a real american orthodoxy it always comes down to it always comes down to tangible things like music which i'm sympathetic to like i like the idea that you know we should know we should eventually sort of figure out like what is you know how how do we do like orthodox chant that's also american or something and and there have been some neat um some neat uh efforts made in this direction which i which i like uh there was a really beautiful one that somebody did for holy week this year and it was kind of an appalachian style chant which is actually historically is tied very closely to like old celtic like still christian but like really old celtic uh chant modes that's where that comes from and so in in that sense you know there is a connection that goes all the way back to the roots of of the christian faith in the west and orthodoxy for the christian but if you meet a christian who is a christian and you go right this isps chronicle of ten roots and this all seems pretended Breathe and no one gets those things right uh and if it is a christian an ethnic or an eth класс or apBon y u need to you know georg for the perfect version according toста b Compendium of Christian Doom if it's a christian or an orthodoxy style chant certainly a christian chant is a moreями year turning 먹고 instead of that a christian prayer we meet a christian a christian name of g party a place of religion or someone whoever let's see what does it look like went up to sort of thing is that you just have to give it some time like if we're going to be orthodox then we need to also uh function with an orthodox scope of time where decisions sometimes take you know decades or even centuries to be made and problems take a long time to resolve and it's better this way it's better this way

15
00:18:46,240 --> 00:22:51,040
Speaker 0: well i just want to build up upon it because i think you actually managed to touch one of the key problem not of just or not problem but pattern of in not in just orthodoxy but also in christianity as such and it's kind of where actually distinguishment between christianity and gnosticism comes in a huge play uh in uh in the acts there is this very famous line when the when the disciples asks lord like will though at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons and i think that's actually one of the key if you want temptation we like humans have after christ because uh it didn't really exist before christ because before christ was created more or less uh it sucks you go to the hades or if you're a superhero maybe you kind of go into like elysium but it's very small person but for most it's just hades after christ it's clear that let's say eschatology basically eschatology comes into the life of everyone effectively willingly or not doesn't matter whether you're a christian or christian but eschatological thinking big is becoming a paradigm of thinking generally speaking but the christian answer is very counterintuitive to anybody it's like yes it is eschatology and even more like in the revelation we know very well how the eschatology is going to play out but the exact times and seasons are not for you to know you need to let it kind of develop upon you like through you but for you to know and that's actually is this anxiety is incredibly hard for within tradition and outside of the tradition we know multiple examples of basically reforms and we don't want to go too deep and we can go into actually it's very interesting topics that uh we know that everybody knows the reformation is the big reformation of martin luther etc etc etc but in a way the first great reformation happened within the catholic church with the great popes of the 10th of the 11th century with thomas aquinas being kind of the biggest fruit of these reforms but for like for three centuries uh the great popes were trying to improve like to improve the church around them to reform whereas and it achieved many great results but then again in three centuries people became anxious again okay there have been three centuries of great reforms and yes there are certain let's say successes but then also like we see people are still not you know in this ideal perfect holy condition which we're expecting them to become after this reformation and the next cycle of anxiety comes into play and anxiety creates two ultimate ways out like you can argue that there are only two types of principal reactions out of anxiety outside of let's say it's either to double down and here we see luther reformation so go really really deep or the second hand is humanism which is also like let's just focus on the secular time okay we can't know anything about revelation like it's kind of somewhere something here but we can't really know so if we can't have it here and now let's just put it aside put it put it into bracket and focus of what we can control and uh that's kind of the two options you have when you can't incorporate this waiting but again it's not a passive painting and that's what i think is very cool in your example the christian rating is the one which is at least we are called to do orthodox waiting is a metamorph like it's a metamorph metamorphical so it's the waiting which is transforming you and that's kind of actually counterintuitive it was never super intuitive i would say as a mainstream thought process but it's even less contrary to duty for us nowadays when we want okay so that's my goal that's my kpi that's how i achieve it how to i cannot you can't put you can basically transform it into technology and that's a big challenge for our like uh time

16
00:22:52,740 --> 00:24:26,580
Speaker 1: there's there's a um this is actually what i've been thinking about all week so i'm really glad that you mentioned reforms because uh there's something about the action of reform that always results in the sort of like the gathering of power right actually babel is a good example of this like you people you should think about babel as a reform like it's a reform movement because what happens is humanity is scattered because of the flood you know or like where humanity is destroyed because of the flood right but though in other words the world is scattered because of the flood right and so the world experiences chaos right so this is chaos and the thing that we want to avoid is being subject to chaos if you want to go back to hobbes right this is what hobbes says is that there's no supreme good but there is a supreme evil and the supreme evil is the fear of violent death right and so well if we can't achieve the supreme good others we can't be saints then we may as well try to make a stable political order right and as as defined by a place where everybody is is safe right and that's this is more or less this is what our society is accepted today so babel uh they say let's let's uh let's reform things or let's reform things and let's rebuild the world well how are we going to rebuild the world let's make a tower and a city what's the tower going to do it's going to protect us but it's also going to it's like you could say building an artificial mountain so when the flood waters rise in other words when we experience chaos again we'll all be safe and we'll be we can build a wall that will keep that out um go ahead

17
00:24:27,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Speaker 0: i just want to add again there is this very important detail in the towel and so tower and sorry for the sound obviously that's when you need to happen but what they started to do before building towers actually starting to making bricks and you can argue that it is a effective symbol of any technological process because people think bricks are intuitive think nowadays but if you ever been to middle east learning to make bricks it's a gigantic technological step forward like and the fact that they kind of making more or less what we use nowadays for roads types of substance so it's not just bricks like so they're collecting this power and they're collecting the power of material change over the world that's happening in a parallel so it's not just uh yeah

18
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:42,520
Speaker 1: and and the there's an interesting detail in the book of jubilees that says that where they get the stuff like the bitumen that they're going to use for the mortar is that they're getting it from the sea so and the sea the sea is you know obviously in this story the sea is chaos right so the idea is not just that we're developing technology but it's like we're going to take chaos and we're going to use it to build a wall and a tower and to keep chaos out right and so that's the that's the and and so that's the reforming impulse if you want to talk about western europe in the

19
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,600
Speaker 0: any reform yeah it's taking the energy of stasis and transforming it sorry so if you go

20
00:25:48,800 --> 00:27:54,760
Speaker 1: around so there was there's this long period of actually waves of reforms that begin as you said about the 10th century and then you know culminate obviously in the protestant reformation actually it's not even really correct i think to talk about one protestant reformation because it was really a gathering of different movements someone quite opposed to each other um and so in the uh so it begins in the the early 10th century there's something around the year 9 10 there's something called the cluniac reforms i don't know if people are aware of this but it's really actually quite important to understanding how the papacy emerges like it does over the 10th in the 11th century and uh because basically uh the the the cluniac reforms which is the reforms within the benedictine monasteries all across western europe what basically happens is they say oh well look all of the normal clergy i'm going to simplify a little bit but all the normal clergy and the normal bishops and everything they're just they're super corrupt and what we need is holiness so we're going to do an end run around that so like instead of like sort of fixing what's going on with the bishops where you have situations like where you have bishops and those bishops have sons maybe illegitimate sons but they're nonetheless they're like passing on the bishopric to their sons or to their nephews or whatever else and so uh basically what happens with the cluniac reforms is that they establish a monastery a network of monasteries across western europe which is not accountable to the local bishop but is instead like this very powerful network that's under basically uh under an ordinary like under somebody who's in charge of the whole network of monasteries who's not a local bishop right and this allows them to get around the corrupt local structure so it's building a tower right it allows them to get around the corrupt local structure the idea is now we're organized and we can be holy but what happens as soon as you organize a big network like this you start gathering power to yourself and that usually power in the form of wealth and power in the forms of you know in these other forms as well but that basically and

21
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:43,160
Speaker 0: that changes very importantly is the understanding of monastic life which adds up like so it's not about metamorphizing yourself but it's about fulfilling a particular task many monastic orders are becoming like i like to actually use this metaphor like in my some classes that's a kind of you know the space marines of church like for people who like so it's it's it's a battle brothers who just you know go into yes so they've kind of in a way becoming this so you for example we have a specific task for example we have a problem of education let's have benedictines we have a problem with uh protestants let's set up jesus but you have a task and for this task you create effectively an arm of a state institution so it is and it's giving you a lot of power and amazing examples of work

22
00:28:43,800 --> 00:29:26,760
Speaker 1: this is a sort of a weird aspect of western christianity to me and i like to me it's the thing uh the development of all these different orders and confraternities in in western christianity in the middle ages sort of like foreshadows the way that protestantism will split into all these different denominations where you're focused on like one particular thing and so now you just sort of split off and you become your own church right there was something like this already happening in the middle ages starting with the starting with these waves of reforms but eventually you know eventually you have somebody like francis of assisi or you know people come along and they found the franciscan order the the Dominican order, the discount Carmelite order, the, you know, all these orders get founded.

23
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,020
Speaker 1: And then we say, oh, no, we need, we, this is not pure enough.

24
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,540
Speaker 1: So we need to split off now and found the Carthusians.

25
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,580
Speaker 1: And, you know, it goes on and on like this.

26
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,080
Speaker 1: And every time that they did this, what they, what would end up happening.

27
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,900
Speaker 1: So it's a weird thing.

28
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,060
Speaker 1: If you read the history of, there's a book actually that people might be interested in.

29
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,440
Speaker 1: Hold on.

30
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,560
Speaker 1: I've just been, I've just been reading it this week.

31
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,680
Speaker 1: So this is why this is on my mind.

32
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Speaker 1: It doesn't start quite this early, but it's, it starts in about the 14th century.

33
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,380
Speaker 1: It's just called reformations.

34
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:07,180
Speaker 1: It's by a guy named Carlos M. and Erie, E-I-R-E, Carlos Erie.

35
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:17,760
Speaker 1: And, but he, he, one of the, one of the interesting things that keeps happening, cause he's talking about the, the sort of the Protestant reformation.

36
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:25,580
Speaker 1: And the, like the early sort of proto-Protestant reformers, but also in tandem, he's talking about all the reformations that are happening inside the Roman Catholic church at the same time.

37
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:39,020
Speaker 1: And one of the weird things that happens is the way that anybody who's a reformer ends up becoming like a, like really draconian authority, you know, totalitarian kind of dictator within their group once they reform it.

38
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:48,240
Speaker 1: And he says, so, so, so he'll, he'll give an example of, yeah, there was this, this group of monasteries and there was this one person that tried really hard to reform it.

39
00:30:48,800 --> 00:31:03,560
Speaker 1: And he says, so, so, so he'll, he'll give And as a result, this group of, and, and, and, and, you know, I, I don't know what the confessional, you know, commitments of the author, if any, are, I don't, I don't know anything, but, but he'll talk about it as like, oh, it's really bad that the Catholic church had all this wealth and power.

40
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,960
Speaker 1: And then, and so this group came along and they said, we want to get rid of all the wealth and power.

41
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,600
Speaker 1: So they organized and they build the tower.

42
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,720
Speaker 1: And then suddenly, and then he says, and because of this, they gained all this wealth and power and influence.

43
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:56,680
Speaker 1: of talking like isn't that great but the the problem is that this creates this the cycle of constantly trying to rebuild the tower constantly the sort of like you build you try to to to construct or something that's orderly and then as you uh amass wealth and power to yourself you get scattered right and so eventually the organization breaks down the protestant reformation itself is a good example of this right where it starts out as a single movement we're trying to get away from the catholic church we're trying to purify things back to what they thought i'm and i i believe genuinely at some point thought that this was more biblical now i don't believe it was obviously i used to be protestant i'm not anymore but um but no

44
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:17,900
Speaker 0: but there are motivations in the beginning like it's pretty clear if you read like and if you read martin luther that's also very important that he was a guy who effectively tried the way so he tried as good as he can to follow let's say the instruction to holiness offered to him and he was genuinely terrified disappointed etc etc so it's not like he just woke up with this wonderful way

45
00:32:18,180 --> 00:35:12,960
Speaker 1: i mean luther's luther's an interesting example because i like he's he's actually uh this whole babble uh pattern on a micro scale because he tries to like build the tower just in his own life he's like okay i'm going to be a holy person i'm going to get rid of all my sin you know by his own account luther was going to confession multiple times a day now you sort of like imagine like your father confessor your parish priest whatever like if you're going to him you're like three or four times a day for confession eventually he's going to tell you you need medical help you know like and i there's a part you know i and i i've always kind of suspected you know nowadays we'd probably look at luther and say maybe he he had like bipolar disorder or something like this but the point is like he really suffered from scrupulosity so he tried to build the tower and then his life fell apart he experiences this scattering and then he says oh it's the church's fault i've got to reform the church and so he starts to build the tower again and then he's like oh i'm going to be a holy person and then with the protestant reformation kicks off again like almost immediately there's a scattering there's a tower of babel moment where almost immediately we go from fighting the pope and fighting the roman catholic church to fighting each other as all these different uh reformation leaders sort of split off and you've got luther's doing one thing and calvin's doing another thing and zwingli's doing another thing and they can't agree on the eucharist and they can't agree on actually what books should be in the bible they can't agree on the most fundamental things in the catholic faith and then another generation and you have like the anabaptist coming along and they're they're changing the definition of marriage and they're changing all these different things and uh and it's this real scattering this real scattering that sort of happens uh that is very much i think that sort of shape of the tower of babel and one of the interesting things is uh that that i think sort of comes about and it this isn't this wasn't luther and calvin's generation but this this comes along sort of later is this idea well i guess we all we tried to make everybody a saint i mean this is the the project of calvin's geneva or some of the the the calvinist cities uh the reform cities in the netherlands right where the idea is we're going to force everyone to live in a certain way so that they can become a saint so then it's like instead of reforming a monastery where at least people are here more or less involved more or less voluntarily right and they've all agreed on a certain rule of life and everything else well with built when calvin started building geneva you know like trying to make it this like the perfect christian city right you know uh it got to the point where um by one account there were people whose job it was to like check and see how many spoons you owned right like like in other words like how much silverware do you have like back back when silverware was actually silver right so check and see like how many spoons how many forks how many knives to make sure that you weren't like accumulating wealth to yourself that would put you over somebody else in the community right so it gets to be like a little draconian and now the now those places are the most secular places in the world

46
00:35:13,580 --> 00:37:59,240
Speaker 0: and it actually makes total sense um sorry again for suffering the sound but I think it's coming actually connected back to gops and one important element important element as I write in the article I sent you he had a very particular understanding of what a human is and that's actually I think kind of connected altogether he calls it a person and in English you know person is just normal word we use it every day but it's actually coming from Greek prosopon the mask and social like and we all wear the mask you can say that you wear the mask when you work for your boss when you are in a way you're when you are talking to me like it's different social roles and actors but where gops was crucial and that's what I think is the point he kind of narrowed down for the whole of human the whole of an individual to this mask and then it becomes clear if all we are is a mask and that's actually very contingent with this whole legal way of thinking about life let's say it's jurisprudential like so like and if we understand for example the confession in a legal way that's also like let's say my mask is confessing let's say I broke the law I need to confess uh then it naturally is that you want to make it hard like obviously like then you you want all the masks to be good because because how else could it be because then if one of your masks it changes the purity of the whole structure whereas if you consider more let's say English like it's definitely orthodox orthodox understanding but I would argue Christian general tradition which we are called to we argue that no mask is enough to describe person there is this mystery of inner life and this mystery can in principle not be touched by any structure by any reform by any like external forces it can be only to be transformed through Christ and through within like but it's always this organic process of waiting and there is no deadline like it's not a timetable like the salvation train doesn't come on a schedule you want like uh effectively effectively as a metaphor but then it definitely changes uh almost expectations then you can leave the room for impurity in a social structure in a social system you don't have to ultimately to build a tower because there is no basically you personally won't be late uh let's say to be saved in a way so you you can leave time for it do you see what I mean I think it's actually comes to the core understanding of our whole so what we mean to be a person what is it is it just the sum of our social relations or is it something which can it can never be put even into on a scale except by let's say the heart like in orthodox original called about as the heart nobody knows the depth of the heart what is the heart

47
00:38:00,720 --> 00:41:40,120
Speaker 1: I mean all of this I was actually thinking this even before you said this so again we're tracking we're on the right path here I think all of this for me really sort of highlights the importance in our tradition of St Gregory of Palamas and his his his life and his the the writings that he left and the but even his homilies like even his homilies directed to lay people um for people who aren't aware uh Saint Gregory essentially defended the orthodox faith against humanism right so you've got Barlam who's who's uh he is a monk he's an orthodox monk but he's a very sort of worldly or like very humanistic monk he's steeped in in Greek philosophy and and uh kind of secular learning and everything and he goes to Mount Athos and here's all these here's all these uh orthodox monks they're praying the Jesus prayer and they don't have any of the education that Barlam has and he basically I mean he calls them navel gazers that's literally that's the epithet that he uses for them and basically says this is a huge waste of time what you should be focusing on is education and it's uh it's uh it's basically the statement right that I was mentioning a moment ago right the kind of the idea of I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush but let's say like just like the worst the worst examples of humanism right um and and and uh you know to go back to Hobbes as a for instance right to say that well you you can't ever be like totally holy in this life so you may as well not try right you may as well instead like focus on just like making human life as good as human life can be right and uh the so the the idea that Saint Gregory is defending against Barlam among other things and he's very complicated stuff a lot of technical reading if you want to get into this but what he's really defending actually is is uh first of all what you just said about the hiddenness of the heart and that that is true both for us but it's also true for God right and God you're not going to find God through uh through you know philosophical training or human learning and it's what I mean by this is to say is that you know if you if you read a bunch of books and you do a lot of philosophical training and then some and then one day you sort of wake up and you realize oh the thing I've been actually looking forward uh for this entire time has been God and to know God and to have a relationship with him right well he's revealed himself to you now he might have used all of these other things but these things didn't reveal God to you God revealed God to you and this is the only way um and so God's heart you go God's heart his essence I mean this whole idea his essence is unknowable right but also the essence of each you know but our essence is unknowable you know like the the the human heart like who we are and what we are is is unknowable but I know you through the relationship that I have right but also I have to understand that there's always a little bit of a gap there between them the more perfectly we work we we live into that relationship the more perfectly we live into that relationship uh the more the better I I know you but with God he has the capacity let's say to reveal himself to reveal himself and you know this is through through his Divine energies but to reveal himself you know sort of directly to the human heart in this in this actually in an unmediated way because this is the this is the crux of the argument is that the energies of God are not media they're not immediate they are God himself they are God himself that's what I'm trying to say so uh the question becomes a sort of a question about the no ability sorry

48
00:41:40,380 --> 00:42:44,640
Speaker 0: I noticed and that's exactly the solves the problem which we're talking about the problem of excite because that's another metaphor basically what uh Saint Palama argues it's like you can know God not as an abstract concept but effectively you can feel like you think he uses as a metaphor of a Sun in one day and energy effectively is the warmth of the Sun so you can actually stand in this Sun and feel it right like but not just sensually feel again yeah technical terms how exactly this feeling happens but and we can argue so what why part of the whole medieval time it was a principal question because for example uh alternatively you have people falling into despair if you read Petrarca of the same time he is in despair because whatever I do I'm not good enough to know God and what's the point like and that's a very real issue and you can if not for nowadays you can say perfection like whatever we do we're never good enough for this perfect image whatever we put into our head so what do we do how can we live with this anxiety so it is a very um it's the same problem it's the same pattern developing in different areas

49
00:42:45,420 --> 00:44:34,420
Speaker 1: yeah it matters because and this is how it ties back to bevel and this is how it ties back to everything we've talked about last time in this time it matters because the question is like what's the telos of the human being like what's the thing that you're made for as a human being and what Saint Gregory says and what Saint Paul says and what the church has always sort of maintained is that the thing you're made for is Union with God right um to not just know things about God but to really know God right and basically what basically what uh Barlam was arguing for is this idea that you can only ever know about God right so pursue philosophical learning pursue education pursue theological learning that's all fine but don't think that you you know because you're sitting on a mountain in a monastery sitting with Jesus prayer and you're seeing you know the uncreated light and all those things don't think you have more of experience of God than I do you know um that kind of a thing uh but then like the I mean Barlam is the one who taught Petrarch Greek like these these guys are really connected right um uh and and this you know and so there's this kind of this kind of this idea that well once you abandon the idea that the thing your life is for is actually to know God then what you're all you're really left with if there's no you know sumum bonum all you're really left with is to say well how can I just make human life as great as it can possibly be and uh um is always you know a really important part of that right um and it's not to say there's not like a good way to go about reform actually one of my favorite examples of a reform controversy is are you I'm sure you're familiar with the possessor controversy in in Russian Orthodox history yeah so it's basically it's basic what's that

50
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,380
Speaker 0: yeah sure in Russian it's called like you see

51
00:44:40,060 --> 00:45:07,720
Speaker 1: yeah like the possessor non-possessor controversy is usually how it's it's uh translated in English and basically it's a it's an argument between the Successors of St Sergius of redanche about or how do you say that word by the way is it rodonch rodonesh okay I I I hear people in English say all kinds of ways um and Russian is not a language that I know very well although I think I found somebody to teach me finally so

52
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,720
Speaker 0: so maybe Nicholas

53
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:22,160
Speaker 1: no no no my community here in in texas but i'm hoping so maybe someday no promises guys but maybe someday we do these conversations in russian that would be if you

54
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,380
Speaker 0: need it if you need any practice just let me know

55
00:45:24,780 --> 00:46:57,920
Speaker 1: ah that would be great that would be great yeah so anyway so saint sergius is um his six his successors you know there's kind of an argument about well should we build our monasteries in the cities so that we can look after the poor and do all these things but also that means by the way you have to own property right you have to own property and which means you have to have somebody administrate it and then you start building wealth and all the problems that come with that or do we just do we live off in a wood in the woods somewhere and just pray and the amazing thing about the orthodox church is that we canonized both of these guys canonize them both and to me that's just always just kind of an amazing uh uh something that's very hard for a western mind to grasp but something i've really come to appreciate in the orthodox church is that the answer is is usually both and usually if you find yourself in a kind of a either or place and this is this is the the problem with every reformer in uh uh this is the problem with every reformer in western history is is that they're they're usually people who can only see things one way right and they they're because they they're they're fixated like they can only see things in this one particular way so luther says no it's got to be all grace why because i already tried and i failed so if i failed obviously everybody has failed right so it could only be grace it's got to be all grace right so they can only see things in one particular way and that's the that's the building the tower that's when you get scattered

56
00:46:58,760 --> 00:50:02,120
Speaker 0: it's this is very wonderful and you said i just wanted to add like speaking about reforms because in like russia has its own even in church example example of a pretty bad reform and it happened later in seven yes and i that's the wound which is kind of if you want to understand russian history you need to understand the 17th century like and that's just it's a topic for another conversation it's kind of how to do things the wrong way yes uh how to do the things the right way though like in both of these guys uh both mister and just like possessors on possessors because possessors kind of they were also building up on part of a tradition which starts with moscow metropolites for example the hola metropolit of alexia of moscow who is in fact you can argue the creator of moscow state like in a way like not maybe from legal perspective but he played a huge role but i would argue that the key difference for us to notice here and it's a very broad speaking is a different principle the difference how would i distinguish between good reform and bad reform good reform seeks only to effectively become a rock doesn't matter whether you're in a forest or doesn't matter whether you're in a city and then around this reform kind of certain ready radiating light is happening or some movement is starting to happen and then the trans the metamorph like metamorphic transformation of a place around this rock is happening whereas bad reform always tries to go to the place to collect the place and to build the tower and that's exactly the difference the problem is the second one pass is which much clearer you can build expectations you can have program it's it's very very clear the first reform is way less tangible it's way less predictable it's way less you can't put it into timetables that's what makes it much much harder but the change is that within its past you keep the core issue where the core phenomenon which i think the whole orthodox encryption is based on the problem of a subject it puts a subject uh as an individual not separated but as a precisely agent you can even argue into the center and you leave it its freedom to turn to be transformed to be like you don't even have to tolerate that's another cool element which often likes another going into the wrong direction is what's okay so if this is all happens let's just not be clear about anything okay if any attempt to build something creates in a tower so let's not just build anything or let not be clear in anything but it's also a wrong way you can be clear and like let's say all the monks were very clear like all fathers were very clear maximus the confessor was so clear it was he had a very difficult life because of because of his clarity but he didn't try let's say to go and start a revolution that's that's what that's the difference i mean so you can be as clear in your agency and experience your uh being an acting subject but you're almost realistic about the extent you can invoke change in ourselves you leave it to them to invoke change

57
00:50:02,560 --> 00:53:22,500
Speaker 1: in ourselves and and very importantly when this goes well it goes well because there's a holy person at its center right who's who's holding things together who's who's become there's a phrase used about saint seraphim of sarov which i just really love that he was totally transparent to jesus christ right so if you have a holy person at center even if i mean and holy does not mean the same thing as polite you know they're famously some saints who who were uh maybe not people you'd want to have over for dinner you know but um but to have a holy person a person who's totally transparent to jesus christ in the time and place where where god has put them they're supposed to be um then uh when a reform happens around them it sort of it carries the authority but it's the authority of christ it's the authority of holiness and it's not the authority of a top-down structure that somebody like rigidly you know um i mean uh to think of like another monastic reformer right saint basil the great who literally if you're orthodox wrote the book on monasticism i mean literally the book right um saint basil the great and and uh we've never had we don't have another kind of monasticism in the orthodox church like we don't have orders we don't have you know any of those things just sort of like we just sort of follow the pattern of life the rule of life that that uh saint basil and obviously others you know the egyptian desert that inheritance as well but but the the but it the things that he wrote right the and the legacy that he left continues to be with us today because of this sort of the authority of the saint that he was the holy person that he was and obviously somebody that got you know had uh an extraordinary you know number of natural talents right a gift for all these different things it uses those things for the kingdom of god but he's still uh at the end of the day the most important thing about him is that he was a saint right he was a saint and um and uh you know and then on you know sometimes also you know they kill you first right you know where they exile you first you know another great reformer saint john chrysostom you know uh was exiled died in exile you know before people started you know really listening to him and taking him seriously sometimes and so anyway and there are many other such cases but i i think this is the this is the other thing is that um something that really seems to me i don't want to be uncharitable to people especially the dead but something that really seems to me to characterize many of the reformers just as i'm kind of reading back through uh you know this this book i'm reading right now it's really the first time that i've read it i mean i used to study and teach about the reformation all the time as an evangelical this is really the first time i'm revisiting it after many years of being orthodox and uh the um the uh thing that seems to really characterize these men as opposed to the saints right is a really just a lack of humility right um a lack of a willingness to sort of submit themselves to a higher authority right especially you know when luther goes and he starts deciding which books are in the bible and aren't or starts deciding like which parts of tradition do i keep or don't right he just sort of says well i'm the one that decides right and um

58
00:53:23,260 --> 00:54:07,400
Speaker 0: and she's in effect like a temptation we all have because that's like we really like i like this part of uh tradition i like this part of scripture this one i don't really like so let's where is the goal is and or and it is hard it's it's a very difficult labor we need to admit like because for every let's say citation from a bible you have a different like opposite citation from a bible that's it creates an enormous freedom of you to let's say pick up whatever you want and you can build very different interpretations which can technically be reliable upon the same scripture and but the job is to integrate everything to accept it as a like wholesomely and that's a hard job to do and like so i just again so you said you wanted to be charitable to these people so yeah every time we look in the mirror we can see the same in us

59
00:54:07,740 --> 00:55:43,000
Speaker 1: well i mean this is the thing i'm not i'm not saying that i'm a humble person i mean this is part of like i'm i'm you know uh you know so for i mean people who don't know i was uh i was i was a protestant minister before we came to the orthodox church and one of the things that you know when we left everybody asked us so are you going to start your own church like this is what you do in the world that i came from if you're not happy with things at your current church you're supposed to leave and start a new one right and this is just what you do and so everybody assumed they asked us oh well let us know when you start your new church and things like this i was like no i'm never starting any churches ever again like i'm just you know i've got to go somewhere that's been there that's older than me right i i uh uh you know i i know too much about myself to want to be a part of any church that i start you know and and um yeah and so that's the that's the thing like it is just um we have to have humility we have to be patient um and i think it's really also really important to kind of to kind of just be able to kind of see yourself with some distance and and perspective the the thing that ties together humanism and all the big reform movements of the 15th and 16th centuries and all that stuff is is a uh is a is a shortening of perspective right where people are you know i've got i've got the answer now boy wait till you guys hear like i've got the solution for this problem and i've got the answer now boy wait till you guys hear like i've got the solution for this problem and got the answer now boy wait till you guys hear like i've got the solution for this problem and you know there's something like especially as americans there's something daring about that that appeals to us

60
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:53,980
Speaker 0: because well yeah i mean because you're the new world and you're above history ultimately like history doesn't matter like it's for this european freaks we are beyond the laws of history this

61
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 1: is why we don't understand why i mean this is why americans don't understand why people in europe can't get their crap together it's like come on guys we've already solved all of the world's problems look how great we have it you know why can't you guys just get on board with the program

62
00:56:08,080 --> 00:57:06,700
Speaker 0: pattern if you notice like you say about this whole uh leave it start your own church the same if you notice the pattern of state creation exactly the same pattern yeah i don't like the state okay let's move to the free land and build my own state like it is it is i agree like for american if you can understand the fact now in american tradition or american pattern it is it has this huge element of here and now uh and then but you're absolutely right that is about i just wanted to notice that where the trick happens after you cannot be okay it's all religious religious mumble jumble so what you're religious people talking about but after the god let's say the secularism for many people was put behind the equation the very same pattern is now playing with the state we expect now just not the church to create the heaven on earth but the state to create on heaven on earth and ideally within the next five years like ideally with these guys who win the election we want him to create literally heaven on earth within the next four years if he doesn't he's not good enough maybe four years is too much ideally immediately yeah

63
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:49,280
Speaker 1: and and it's one of the things that i mean this is why i kind of got really tired with american politics i grew up in a very like politically active family and worked on different campaigns and things like that when i was young and and but just like i at some point i realized like the cycle is impossible there is no way that you can affect meaningful change in a country of 300 million people 300 million people like the romans couldn't do it and they had like a tenth of our population like there's no way that you can you can affect a meaningful change in a country of 300 million people in four in a four-year cycle like that's it's complete nonsense you couldn't do it in four generations uh and and but

64
00:57:49,340 --> 00:59:48,200
Speaker 0: you cannot not expect but the whole pattern of expectation is already so deeply ingrained that we don't realize where it's coming from but it kind of almost rules over us that's i think one of the most fascinating pattern i just wanted them to finish like as an opposite like do you know like uh nicolas bernanke as a philosopher uh he's a really good russian like strong russian philosopher of the 20th century and has a quote which i really love uh which kind of distinguishes in my opinion the gnostic approach to the state and powers with uh like more skeptical and realistic which here he says that the purpose of the state is not to create a heaven on earth but just let it not to dissolve in hell immediately like like and i think it is just this changing of an optic and changing of expectation it's also very to me characteristics that people talk about freedom all the time and again this topic hopefully we will have after you will have like back in august or in september because i would want to continue it that uh we're so we're so rooting for freedom but at the same time we expect something external to give us this freedom and to create it on our behalf which is also kind of almost a paradox like because if you really that much into freedom and i agree with the christians we are very much into freedom just it's the freedom to transform yourself and this freedom is specifically not from the state like no state no president no like can give you this particular freedom and that is the freedom which you actually seek so it is very paradoxical and like as you i know in jonathan's circle you call it the clown world and i think it's a very accurate description how all of the ideas are intertwined to become to be almost a mockery of what they used to be but still repeating the same pattern which is also very fascinating oh okay so yeah i guess we're wrapping up so again thank you for amazing conversation again i'm very grateful for your time i hope we both have more in the future i definitely

65
00:59:48,340 --> 01:00:06,800
Speaker 1: do when i've got a bunch of travel coming up but when i get back i would love to talk some more um and uh your audience thanks to your audience you guys don't know how hard it has been to nail me down for conversation very very patient so thanks to him and thanks to you all uh you're very kind to have me on thank you very much

66
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:14,400
Speaker 0: thank you okay guys and yeah subscribe to no actually richard doesn't have a channel so don't subscribe to the channel

67
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:39,540
Speaker 1: yeah yeah don't i i actually so i i have a youtube channel that i don't post anything on i really studiously try to avoid having my own channel uh because uh there's just too much i've got too many other things to do and i feel like if i had to if i had to do it you know i would have to do it myself i would have to do it myself you do or like what jonathan does like jonathan has like you know three videos a week or something i would just lose my mind like uh so i'm i'm very happy just to have

68
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:54,640
