1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,120
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,540
Speaker 0: Okay.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,300
Speaker 0: Hello, dear audience.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,060
Speaker 0: Today, I have a special guest, which I would like to invite you to participate in our conversation with.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,980
Speaker 0: This guest is John Hears.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,600
Speaker 0: And John is one of the most welcoming persons I've ever met.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,960
Speaker 0: He is one of the best hosts in the most general meaning of the world.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:45,000
Speaker 0: host like both as a podcast holder both as a tamada which we will talk about it later and he's my dear friend so welcome you i will like to welcome you on my channel

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,280
Speaker 1: it is a joy we got a lot to talk about

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: exactly and what i want to talk about today generally speaking is connected with the season so we are recording this conversational this conversation several weeks before lent and this year is a special year when lent starts more or less the same for all denominations and that's why i think it's a really good occasion to talk about feast and fast and the interesting dance that happens between these two phenomenons as on all levels of reality but i want to start with more joyous thing like so As an expert on feasting, John, how would you describe a feast?

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,220
Speaker 0: What is an essence of a feast and why it matters nowadays?

12
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,320
Speaker 0: How would you say it is?

13
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,120
Speaker 1: I start with my spiritual father in the Russian tradition of Rokor.

14
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,260
Speaker 1: He was sitting with me.

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,340
Speaker 1: This is when I was a young Orthodox Christian, a convert from Protestantism, Episcopalian.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,760
Speaker 1: In the United States.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,120
Speaker 1: And he said.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
Speaker 1: He was with two other single guys.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,900
Speaker 1: And.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Speaker 1: We were talking about.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,380
Speaker 1: My potential wife.

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,500
Speaker 1: And I was very.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,100
Speaker 1: The best way to describe it.

24
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,880
Speaker 1: Is I was serious about my faith.

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,320
Speaker 1: Maybe to a fault.

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,180
Speaker 1: I was zealous.

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,020
Speaker 1: And I was very interested.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
Speaker 1: If she could do it.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 1: Be orthodox.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaker 1: And he said.

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,180
Speaker 1: I want to ask you a question.

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 1: How does she feast?

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,160
Speaker 1: And I was like confused.

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Speaker 1: But how does she feast?

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,440
Speaker 1: What does it look like?

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,900
Speaker 1: And I didn't know the answer.

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:54,200
Speaker 1: I had never really talked about the importance of sacrifice as toward a proper communion and the outcome being a beautiful family through the dedication to Christ.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,360
Speaker 1: And we could go on and on.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,820
Speaker 1: But I had never taken this question seriously.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 1: And it was during this time period that I left.

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,560
Speaker 1: I didn't marry this woman.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,620
Speaker 1: I went to Georgia, the Georgian Republic, where I got.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,760
Speaker 1: I got trained in hospitality and orthodoxy.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 1: Long story short, I think the answer is that a feast is the intimation of heaven.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Speaker 1: And the intimation of heaven is the ultimate, it's how we know hope.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:33,500
Speaker 1: And so I don't understand people who don't naturally gravitate toward feast.

47
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 1: as the ultimate moment of hope.

48
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,260
Speaker 1: And so now there's drunkenness, guilty.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,540
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of guilty.

50
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,360
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of problems with the feast, but there's all kinds of problems with the fast.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,720
Speaker 1: And so I think it's just what happens when people hope is that they want to set a table.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Speaker 1: They want something to overflow.

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,580
Speaker 1: And in Orthodox theology, it's Pascha, right?

54
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,360
Speaker 1: And Christ isn't contained in the grave.

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Speaker 1: So there's an overflow.

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,480
Speaker 1: And the Georgians taught me there should always be more on the table than you can eat.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaker 1: And for an American ear trained in efficiency and pragmatism, it doesn't make sense.

58
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Speaker 1: It's like there's too many remainders.

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Speaker 1: You know, two plus two is four.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
Speaker 1: Why do we have all these remainders?

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 1: And I think the nature of the feast is to have excess.

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,900
Speaker 1: Because there's no reason we should have excess, Pavel.

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
Speaker 1: I'm interested in you as a philosopher.

64
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,660
Speaker 1: What is the philosophical explanation of more than we need?

65
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,340
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about that?

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
Speaker 1: It's a very hard question to answer.

67
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,100
Speaker 0: It is.

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Speaker 1: You know, like God exists as more.

69
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,100
Speaker 1: God exists as beyond.

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Speaker 1: And so in some ways, the nature of our existence is the beyond.

71
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,020
Speaker 1: We are meant to have more than we can imagine.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,640
Speaker 1: And the feast is an intimation of that.

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker 0: Well, I never thought truth be told about this in a way, like in a philosophical manner.

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,660
Speaker 0: But your question brought several associations, which I will share and we'll see where it goes.

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,240
Speaker 0: First, I think.

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:07:51,440
Speaker 0: I think during the feast and more it's a very good reminder that any movement per se like any movement generally speaking in physical reality or in a human social reality is a consequence of a form of desire like and so you desire something you move towards what is desirable so in a way the desire creates movement and the tricky part about it don't even think about it properly on the one hand a human desire is insatiable you one can say so like it's never truly enough but it's almost never truly enough in our imagination it's like almost in illusions in simulacrums if you want to put it this way in virtual reality whenever face you with real reality suddenly you surprise you almost always have enough you have enough of human communication you have enough of human interaction you have enough of food you have enough of water etc etc so but ironically like if we're talking about a little bit adding theological aspect to it god is something which is never enough like you can definitely so it's something which is always keeps feeling the one who desires it so it's one i i don't remember which holy father said but effectively it's never ending movement like it's never ending the movement of desire i think it's kind of similar in dante's allegory like of uh heaven like that there is a constant movement around the sun or something like this so in a sense in an excess in a good feast like in a i will highlight in a good feast feast which purpose is not to get drunk for the drunkenness sake but this which is the purpose which is ordered to a higher purpose is to remind us that we still have a gigantic work to do in a heart expansion exercise to actually be capable of desiring more of a good things and being capable of keeping them that's what kind of thought which hit me like when you ask the question I think it's I think there is sort of connection here like because we're so trained in ironically like we're trained both neither in access nor in moderation I would put it this way we're really trained in this very awkward flat line gray zone if you want to put it and any breakage of this great zone is equally a challenge.

77
00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Speaker 0: I just recently have been with a good friend of ours, which has been to Art of Tamada today, so back in Kyle, and that's what I kind of thought struck me there is that I think it's not a coincidence that in a culture of the new world, as you describe it, it's equally challenging for us to fast and to feast.

78
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,140
Speaker 0: And there is some very interesting direction happening here.

79
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:17,900
Speaker 0: I don't know.

80
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,540
Speaker 1: You think philosophically it's played out in the role of the guest and the host.

81
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,120
Speaker 1: So one of the drawbacks, I call them light people.

82
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,440
Speaker 1: And so this is my sub stack and other places where I like to try to express our work.

83
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, good.

84
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,659
Speaker 1: The light people is a play, of course.

85
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,420
Speaker 1: on enlightenment, but also on this category called whiteness.

86
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
Speaker 1: And we can get into that.

87
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,880
Speaker 1: I'm not sure that that category is real.

88
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,760
Speaker 1: I think it exists mostly as a modern phenomenon.

89
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:08,040
Speaker 1: But let's just, light people are folks who have been trained to imagine in a Cartesian way that the answers are all found in our discursive thoughts.

90
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:45,880
Speaker 1: And there's something about the feasting that i've done and been blessed to be a part of which is often georgian but not just georgian lived in africa west africa east africa there's something about the intimation of eternity when someone is sitting you down and giving you so much that you start to feel uncomfortable now a light person feels uncomfortable let me try to explain this i want to play around with this for me a light person, let's call him a modern inheritor of the enlightenment, European enlightenment.

91
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Speaker 1: There's something about us that we're taught to be self-sufficient as an act of goodness.

92
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Speaker 1: It's like, because I am self-sufficient, I am also good.

93
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,100
Speaker 1: Which, of course, is not a Christian narrative at all.

94
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:42,580
Speaker 1: So when the host starts to act like God, and I find this in Islam too, when i live with muslims when the host starts to present like a god in other words it's more than you can imagine it feels like they're giving from even from things they can't give from in other words they're poor and yet they they lavish you a light person starts to feel very uncomfortable um at least i do i'm one of those people i'm always trying to be less of one but i'm not saying they're bad i'm not saying but the enlightenment has problems so Let me ask you a question, if any of these presuppositions are correct.

95
00:10:43,640 --> 00:11:04,380
Speaker 1: When I start to feel bad, I'm not playing a proper role of the guest, which is the acceptance of the grace, which is exactly the same role between God and I. If I imagine myself as self-sufficient, which is a bit of a Protestant theology, then I can imagine myself as sort of equal to the host, the host being God.

96
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,000
Speaker 1: Now I have a... I'm a disordered guest.

97
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,880
Speaker 1: I haven't come to receive.

98
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,880
Speaker 1: I've come to add to my host.

99
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,940
Speaker 1: I find all of this very interesting.

100
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,300
Speaker 1: I think it's all tied up with feasting.

101
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,340
Speaker 1: I don't always know how.

102
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,520
Speaker 1: We can work it out.

103
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:31,840
Speaker 1: But there's something about the role of the guest in our world in the West that is not allowed a proper feasting because we don't allow the host to be truly a host.

104
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,800
Speaker 0: What do you think about that?

105
00:11:33,880 --> 00:12:31,820
Speaker 0: I think you... actually touched a very deep point very deep illusion we all share as guests and we're in a way all guests to the feast of life if you if you let me this metaphor i think it's an illusion of control i think it's an illusion of self-control like we want to believe and to act as if it's true that we are in control of our lives and the trick is we are but not in the way we think we are like you're in control you are in control of your life precisely no matter you can be a good guess that's upon you you're in control of your life and then like the way you order your heart like you can really like that's highly upon you like the way you exactly push your heart expand your heart move beyond this you know like it's even you know bastardized and you know pop up psychology like get out of the comfort zone but in a way it is get out of your comfort zone

106
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,620
Speaker 1: right it's built on something true that concept

107
00:12:35,800 --> 00:13:13,640
Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so and this true concept is like we have this illusion which we build this walls around ourselves this atomization because at least within this wall i believe i can control everything that happens and nothing bad can happen to me or if it's happening bad it's because i'm bad or something like it's the result of my lack of control and a true feast as you've been talking is a challenge exactly to this if you're coming as a like ideally if you're coming as a guest you don't know what you will be served like exactly like you maybe some most general understanding but you don't know exactly what you will serve like you don't know who exactly will be there like

108
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,640
Speaker 1: how long how long you don't

109
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,980
Speaker 0: know how long You don't know how long it's going to take.

110
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,720
Speaker 0: All these small details, but you are not in control.

111
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,780
Speaker 0: You are part of this thing, but you are not in control of this thing.

112
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Speaker 0: And it is challenging, legitimately, for us.

113
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,560
Speaker 0: It can be really, really challenging.

114
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,960
Speaker 0: So I think it's connected with this idea of control.

115
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,180
Speaker 0: But then the life itself is not controlled.

116
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,160
Speaker 0: You don't control whether you're sick or...

117
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,780
Speaker 1: This is it.

118
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:53,200
Speaker 1: It really does... It does speak of... The integration of theology with practical life, which is what I really appreciate by a lot of these guys on the internet now

119
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,180
Speaker 0: who are

120
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:03,440
Speaker 1: managing to take, you're one of them, who are managing to take very difficult ideas that seem to be far away and really relate them to our everyday existence.

121
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,340
Speaker 1: Because this also will speak to how we meet our neighbor, right?

122
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,820
Speaker 1: In other words, feasting and fasting is also about neighbor to neighbor relationships because I got to talk to this guy.

123
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,900
Speaker 1: How long do I have to spend with him?

124
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
Speaker 1: There's this attitude we always need to get back to what I can control.

125
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,500
Speaker 1: And what I can control is what I'm going to watch, what I'm going to eat.

126
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,160
Speaker 1: I think it's a major, I would not even say a major problem.

127
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,020
Speaker 1: What I would say is that the core of what people in the West.

128
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:45,700
Speaker 1: are now clamoring against but i don't think they would name it a lack of feasting and fasting or i don't think they name it an inappropriate guest host relationship i think they name it economics they would name it like not enough opportunity

129
00:14:46,380 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 0: you know and i hear i think absolutely i think it's first i really want to not defend west in that respect not not because i like but just the problem is not in the west or east etc i think like proper way of understanding is modernity and yes west kind of created modernity but then it kind of spread around the whole world and it became common let's say if you wanted a common poison if we are borrowing the basically c.s lewis's language he called it commonly poisoned like basically we brew the poison but the poison became spread around everywhere so i think it's just more correct talk about it in this form because it's not the western problem like unfortunately like i wish it may be part of my wish i could say no i

130
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,240
Speaker 1: think you're

131
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,520
Speaker 0: right i think

132
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:41,740
Speaker 1: it's a better way to describe it as uh modern and pre-modern or enlightenment and pre-enlightenment yeah

133
00:15:41,780 --> 00:16:47,440
Speaker 0: kind kind yeah that's just more intellectually clear what we are talking about and uh this idea of exactly neighbor and atomization again in the pattern of feasting and fasting it's exactly the same pattern which breaks this idea of a modern man because modern man is not truly alone but he is neither truly social like if you consider the feast to being the pinnacle of communion like a true communion you know like the like love jointly spread like love spreading around all the members of community and desires spreading all around of the members of community and the way everybody cares about each other in the table like do you want this do you want that or a little bit more of this like stuff like this and faster than a proper let's say proper individualism if you want to put it this way so it's a place when I limit myself when I introspect myself when I go into the depths of my heart then it's exactly two opposites of exactly the spectrum which modernity rejects both because you we kind of want to be neither.

134
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,240
Speaker 0: We don't want to be truly in communion, but we also don't want to be truly in ourselves.

135
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,320
Speaker 0: Like modern man finds loneliness, truth be told.

136
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:18,640
Speaker 0: unbearable that's why we need all the sound around us like we need to constantly some sound in our ears and some some visual stimulation some audio stimulation so like everything's a true fast is against but we need it because we are not truly like we are not amongst no i don't know no or something right right

137
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,680
Speaker 1: nor feet right what's the opposite of the monk i guess is the um Yeah, the socialized

138
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,200
Speaker 0: citizen.

139
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
Speaker 0: I don't know, jester, if you want to put it in a way, like absolute opposite.

140
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,940
Speaker 0: Yes, yes.

141
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,800
Speaker 0: Some sort of this.

142
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,780
Speaker 0: Yes.

143
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,100
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, you've been writing about neither lord nor hermit.

144
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,840
Speaker 0: So you are neither lord nor hermit.

145
00:17:42,720 --> 00:18:01,660
Speaker 0: And in our life, that's the challenge of feasting and fasting routines that you kind of need to... move between both so that's sometime of a hermitism and then sometime of a lordship and then it's kind of flow continuity but it is challenging and just that's what i find very interesting like

146
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 1: well i used to think um so i'm interested in your take i know you're you're often speaking about orthodoxy

147
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,220
Speaker 0: how would you

148
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:41,880
Speaker 1: how would you categorize orthodoxy uh obviously it's a religion it's a worldview it's a it's a it's an epistemology it's a way of knowing so let's let's just say when i adopted that orthodoxy as a as a hope as a type of glasses through which to see just kantian but let's just leave it like that for

149
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,240
Speaker 0: a minute um i've

150
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,480
Speaker 1: been i i started I've been wanting the whole, I've been wanting the jester, and I've been wanting the communion.

151
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,560
Speaker 1: Because as a modern person before orthodoxy, I got all the characteristics of an individual.

152
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,860
Speaker 1: I was rewarded by being a good individual in the way that the West rewards individuals.

153
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,740
Speaker 1: And I've been trying to shed, but it's a little bit disingenuous.

154
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,400
Speaker 1: Because I'm creating false dichotomies as I go.

155
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,420
Speaker 1: And the true Orthodox person is integrating the two.

156
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,940
Speaker 1: They're not fighting one against the other.

157
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Speaker 1: And even when I do my podcast, I catch myself.

158
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,760
Speaker 1: And there's a reason I catch myself.

159
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,020
Speaker 1: It's because it's fun to juxtapose old and new.

160
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,960
Speaker 1: It's fun to be a battler.

161
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,880
Speaker 1: And it's fun to, it's interesting anyway, to create really articulate.

162
00:19:46,320 --> 00:20:05,760
Speaker 1: opposites but i'm learning as i got older as an orthodox person my job is integration and and so in some way feast and fast is an integration right into what we've always meant to be so pavel the and i always say your name the way i say it but it's kind of it's kind of how people

163
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,880
Speaker 0: it's the way you love it don't worry

164
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,420
Speaker 1: so guess what though the prodigal does not return he returns to his father but he returns to a feast

165
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,380
Speaker 0: yes

166
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,620
Speaker 1: you have to remember that the father says go find the lamb

167
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:57,520
Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah the feast is created for his return absolutely yeah it's it's like because feast is an ultimate goal i would say all images of heaven are not about fasting like it or not it's about feasting like and all the symbolism is about feasting it's the fast is a preparation for the feast like the fast if anything it's precisely the period so you can appreciate the feast more like it's something which makes the feast stronger but i think it is very important again in the context of land uh because land is a complicated topic nowadays i think i will a little bit derail and then come back because i think it is related

168
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,760
Speaker 1: uh

169
00:20:59,100 --> 00:23:02,920
Speaker 0: what we what we miss nowadays is that historically speaking land was always kind of organic process like it wasn't you know set of special rules like very complicated rules to follow or like very you know this neat picking of like can i actually eat this or can i actually eat this or like does this count or does it's not like it was more or less organic again like the exact set of rules we most commonly tend to use nowadays were actually created in a very particular historical context in a very particular communities actually mediterranean communities and mostly for monks and it's kind of became easy especially in other regions to then forget what is the purpose and especially since we moved into the age of abundance because historically like let's say not eating meat was not that much of a challenge for people because simply you eat meat only when you celebrate there was not simply even an idea of like you just eat meat every day like so it was so the rules were reflecting the bigger point and nowadays i think it's really important to rediscover the point i think if you want to put it this way not really hidden it's not hidden it's in the open but something we kind of tend to often overlook behind the rules like the point of all of us is to prepare yourself for the feast and that's just i think is a big area of a conversation of talking about it or explaining about it like not explaining just talking about it effectively to start because then it makes sense why like that what is the land is what's the purpose of a land is the purpose of a land is not to have a dietary restriction like that's just very clear but in modern day and age because of we are so far away from this organic world which whatever the rules were created it looks very artificial and like often in like you know families when one member is orthodox and another is not orthodox it's actually very challenging to explain why this is included and this is not included like it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense are you vegan or you're not vegan you know this type like what what are these rules for

170
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:15,620
Speaker 1: what do you think of the move though many modern churches The Orthodox still try to go by whatever the rules have been.

171
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Speaker 1: And the Catholics say, okay, pick something.

172
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,900
Speaker 1: Pick something and don't eat it on Friday.

173
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,220
Speaker 1: Or pick something and don't eat it.

174
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,160
Speaker 1: Don't eat chocolate.

175
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,900
Speaker 1: There's a mechanism for individual choice or something.

176
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,860
Speaker 1: And is that an attempt to wrestle with modernity?

177
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,300
Speaker 0: I definitely think it's an attempt to wrestle with us in modernity.

178
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,500
Speaker 0: And I will be open.

179
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
Speaker 0: I don't have a universal great answer for it.

180
00:23:39,700 --> 00:24:25,060
Speaker 0: I think what is ultimately important and I think the almost answer will be parish by parish base truth be told like or something like this like because like ideally it should be based on a personal relations almost between to an extent priest and like you know as a parish member like there should be that general guideline and we definitely have a general guideline but the emphasis is definitely and I think I'm witnessing it more the definitely emphasis is becoming more in a spirit like like we need to make the let's say the technical rules more order towards the spirit of the spirit of a fast and that's where I think feast is coming from because that's where I think uh almost the challenge for fasting nowadays is that we are not feasting.

181
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,480
Speaker 0: Again, I promise that I think this dual relationship is the key.

182
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:40,340
Speaker 0: Because unless you have this big, abundant, excessive, moving beyond all of the ordinary borders feast at the end of a fasting period, it almost doesn't make sense to fast.

183
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
Speaker 0: Like, ironically speaking.

184
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,120
Speaker 1: You're speaking, I love this thought.

185
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,560
Speaker 1: Let's play that out for a second.

186
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:58,600
Speaker 1: I want to get a little, let's, I'll share something as the Tamada.

187
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,580
Speaker 1: So the Tamada is a Georgian.

188
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,700
Speaker 1: We got to stay on this topic because I go all over it, but I want to stay on this because I'm going to bring it right to it right now.

189
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,820
Speaker 1: But the Tamada is a Georgian toastmaster.

190
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:17,280
Speaker 1: And I've been adopted by Georgians and I've adopted everything that they do in terms of throwing this party called the Supra.

191
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,580
Speaker 1: And we do it at a restaurant.

192
00:25:20,620 --> 00:26:18,920
Speaker 1: as you know and you've been it was a wonderful time it was so it was good so good to feast with you so but here's what's happened is i've i've been hosting a lot of people at the restaurant not not not even not tens and tens but hundreds and hundreds common americans who come in and want to feast in this georgian tradition is very unique and i've met a lot of young people and something's happening it's very interesting um there's like a neutrality of sexual desire so you didn't think i was going to go there but i want to go there there seems to be even among secular people that i talk to they'll come in with their boyfriend there's something like a friendship that is pre-dating that's the wrong word but predating the sexuality of their attraction in other words they're friends in a neutral way and not thinking about sex.

193
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:27,160
Speaker 1: And so why I bring this up, because you said you really need to know how to fast in order to, to feast in order to fast.

194
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:36,240
Speaker 1: And you made me think that there is a weird thing happening in society right now, where it's like, let's ignore the edges.

195
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,160
Speaker 1: Let's ignore the fast and the feast.

196
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,760
Speaker 1: And let's get right down to this Royal path.

197
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:50,460
Speaker 1: And it's like, these, these couples are, They're ignoring the beauty of the feast, which is the sex of a married couple, right?

198
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,540
Speaker 1: And they're trying to go right to this middle place of friendship as if it was a moral good.

199
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,560
Speaker 1: And therefore, then they don't also fast.

200
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,600
Speaker 1: They don't have to fight the desire to not be with each other.

201
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,560
Speaker 1: For instance, I don't want to sit on a couch with a woman and date them for year after year.

202
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,500
Speaker 1: Because the joy in some ways is the feast, which is the sexual relation.

203
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,400
Speaker 1: You see what I'm saying?

204
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,560
Speaker 1: Which would imply then that I get to be around her, but as a faster.

205
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:33,660
Speaker 1: And so as anyone who's fasting knows, you don't sit around and fry up chicken and sit there and make all the most delicious meal and then don't eat it.

206
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,180
Speaker 1: It's very weird.

207
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,040
Speaker 1: And so I want to throw this to you.

208
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,400
Speaker 1: It's torturous, but what I've noticed is.

209
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,940
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call them ascetics.

210
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,940
Speaker 1: See, this is what's so weird.

211
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,860
Speaker 1: This is what I'm trying to say.

212
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,400
Speaker 1: I'll say it.

213
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,340
Speaker 1: Doing these tables have introduced me to non-ascetic ascetics.

214
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,300
Speaker 1: People who practice asceticism without it being ascetic.

215
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,340
Speaker 1: In other words, there is no feast that they're trying to avoid.

216
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,420
Speaker 1: And I think it's very unhealthy.

217
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Speaker 1: I think it's much healthier if we lived with more passion.

218
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,940
Speaker 1: and more with more feasting passionate for the for the desire for the thing and more fasting i don't

219
00:28:16,100 --> 00:29:01,080
Speaker 0: know no it makes a little sense and and that's actually well let's go deeper but i think it's exactly the same pattern of life and death because any life is a product of movement the only place when there is no movement is the movement of death and this uh proper asceticism is aimed ultimately towards life one way or another as an abundant feast literally or an abandoned feast when let's say monks start seeing energies it's like it's better than a fist it's not like it's not abstract it's more like sensual according to what we know it's more sensual even in indescribably intense and you're a good a good fist is so it's this but more and more purified, et cetera, but it's this.

220
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,680
Speaker 0: Or we can say that feast is this, but it's more down-to-earth form.

221
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,580
Speaker 0: So that's a proper monasticism.

222
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:20,020
Speaker 0: But the quasi-monasticism you are talking about, and I definitely see it a lot, let's be honest, in myself or people around me, it's exactly the desire of neither.

223
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:32,560
Speaker 0: So it's the desire of stability, the lack of movement, because here comes an interesting part, because... In any proper host and guest relationship, so in any movement, there is always a hidden danger.

224
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,740
Speaker 0: It's always a double-edged sword.

225
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,180
Speaker 0: Yes.

226
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,720
Speaker 0: So a certain bravery is required to be alive, if you want to put it this way.

227
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,200
Speaker 0: A certain bravery is required to be with a woman.

228
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,020
Speaker 0: A certain bravery is required to be a guest.

229
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,840
Speaker 0: And I guess that means we're just very coward people.

230
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,920
Speaker 0: Like modern man is a very coward thing.

231
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,000
Speaker 1: This is... You put the words to what I was trying to say, which is there's these beautiful people.

232
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,580
Speaker 1: By the way, people are beautiful.

233
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,020
Speaker 1: They have simply avoided the possibility of the sword of the danger.

234
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,500
Speaker 1: You're absolutely right.

235
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,260
Speaker 1: And somehow I want to pat him on the back as a father of daughters.

236
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:21,880
Speaker 1: But I don't think it's a good thing because it it leads the man into a place of some sort of.

237
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:30,040
Speaker 1: weakness in not being able to admit the danger of your manhood to your girl.

238
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,220
Speaker 1: I desire the feast.

239
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,960
Speaker 1: And so I can't lay on your couch all night.

240
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,180
Speaker 1: I really like that.

241
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,620
Speaker 1: It's also very old world.

242
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,560
Speaker 1: Very Georgian.

243
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Speaker 1: And I think Russian if you go back in time.

244
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,220
Speaker 0: Any traditional like Serbian.

245
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,000
Speaker 0: German, French, any traditional culture.

246
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:02,260
Speaker 1: Any tradition where the man is meant to be in the presence of a woman and burn in ways that only he knows because he's so strong.

247
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,180
Speaker 1: But he would admit to a burning.

248
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,920
Speaker 1: He would admit to a fire and a fight within himself if asked, especially by other men.

249
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:18,700
Speaker 1: But by the woman, he would simply either remove himself or he would move toward marriage, of course, or other things.

250
00:31:19,160 --> 00:32:20,480
Speaker 0: yeah but but that's the thing yeah it's exactly still the pattern like at least the recognition of a desire and taking responsibility for this desire one way or another which also requires bravery and again we're coming to this uh point of kind of false comfort again sorry really sound that's the way i wanted but it kind of is a false comfort because it's kind of like even in like 20th century russian songs like couple very popular one uh basically there is this line like if you if you are not living you don't have to die something along this line so in in a way like you can say that this cowardness is also related to this fear of death because both feast if you say that feast is this image of life in its fullest like an image not life in its fullest but it's an image of life in its fullest And fast is an image of willing full spiritual death to come back to life.

251
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,200
Speaker 0: Let's say to go like into the desert and to go into the grave to an extent and then to come back to life.

252
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,180
Speaker 0: Then this quasi-asceticism isn't either.

253
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,780
Speaker 0: It's neither life nor death.

254
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,860
Speaker 0: It's this kind of in-between.

255
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
Speaker 0: It's constant limbo.

256
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,900
Speaker 0: Like if you want to put it this way, it's a limbo.

257
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:43,280
Speaker 0: And limbo became such a norm for just as you can call it even a spirit of time.

258
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
Speaker 0: The spirit of time is limbo.

259
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,160
Speaker 0: zen that's

260
00:32:46,260 --> 00:33:21,200
Speaker 1: good that's very true it's a spiritual limbo i do think i do think we're in a but i do think we're in an age of i do think there's desire there's greed um but spiritually i do think it is it's an empty time but it's being filled up it's it's being filled up by the you know the powers and the principalities of post-modernism but also There's a Christian narrative that's returning, I think, all over the modern world.

261
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Speaker 1: What will it become?

262
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,860
Speaker 1: That's a really good question.

263
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,440
Speaker 1: You made me had a thought.

264
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
Speaker 1: Can I share it with you?

265
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:39,300
Speaker 1: I think I get into this a lot, this philosophy of the table and of feasting, and I love it.

266
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,800
Speaker 1: I think I want to really write a book about this, but I want to say this to you.

267
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,440
Speaker 1: What I noticed about the Georgian Supra, which, by the way, can happen three or four times in a week.

268
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,120
Speaker 1: So I just want you to know that like we know families in Georgia that they're not trying.

269
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,900
Speaker 1: They're not like on Friday, big party.

270
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,960
Speaker 1: It builds on itself.

271
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,860
Speaker 1: So the mother and the auntie will cook and then the guests will come over and then another person.

272
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,840
Speaker 1: And it's just sort of happens.

273
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
Speaker 1: But it happens.

274
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,820
Speaker 1: And this is what I want to share.

275
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,120
Speaker 1: It happens with order.

276
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,739
Speaker 1: And I think a proper feast has elements of the fast.

277
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,920
Speaker 1: Yes.

278
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,920
Speaker 1: And so much like monasticism, you would never say it's always a fast if you go to a monastery.

279
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Speaker 1: There's great, even in a funeral, you feel bright sadness.

280
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,620
Speaker 1: There's always a hint of joy in a monastery.

281
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Speaker 1: And at a proper feast, at least I would argue the Georgians have done as well as anyone in history doing a proper feast.

282
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,380
Speaker 1: You wouldn't see it at a round table if they can avoid it.

283
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,639
Speaker 1: There might be a round table, but the round table implies some sort of equality and democracy.

284
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,639
Speaker 1: Instead, you're going to see a long table with a head.

285
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,219
Speaker 1: The head is usually a toastmaster who calls everything to attention.

286
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,220
Speaker 1: You wouldn't be very odd to have a Tamada that doesn't call the table to attention, the odd table.

287
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,480
Speaker 1: And at the other end of the table is usually the oldest male.

288
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,720
Speaker 1: which is a sign of, it's like a bookend sign of, you know, God, the father, God, the son, bishop.

289
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:16,400
Speaker 1: And there's all this order and there's order in the toasting, but there's a major consumption of wine, which is the ultimate, right?

290
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,120
Speaker 1: In many ways, for many people, that's the ultimate expression of feast.

291
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,520
Speaker 1: But the Georgian table, you drink a lot, but it's like not the point to drink a lot.

292
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,780
Speaker 1: The point is to honor a lot or to be in a constant state of honor.

293
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,860
Speaker 1: and offering honor.

294
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,420
Speaker 0: And vulnerability.

295
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,260
Speaker 0: That's, I think, very connected.

296
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,840
Speaker 0: Maybe you can connect vulnerability and honor as a pair.

297
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,860
Speaker 1: Let me do that because it's really true.

298
00:35:51,340 --> 00:36:02,060
Speaker 1: Someone, a dishonorable person, let's just say a dishonorable person approaches you and in that approach, you sense something like dishonor.

299
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,300
Speaker 1: The last move at that point is for you to be vulnerable.

300
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:14,540
Speaker 1: You'll immediately begin to meet his perceived dishonor with some sort of guard or attack.

301
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:28,200
Speaker 1: And so at a supra, when it's most beautiful is when the tamarad is most honorable because he provides a safe place for the vulnerability of his guests.

302
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:40,160
Speaker 1: And they know that when they act in a vulnerable way through a toast about their mother or something that was said to them, the Tamada will protect them with his honor.

303
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,980
Speaker 1: And you see tables that go sideways.

304
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:55,620
Speaker 1: You see fat feasts that go sideways are when the table demands that the Tamada not enter as an authority figure, but rather sits on the side.

305
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,900
Speaker 1: And then you see a lot of dishonor, but you also see less vulnerability.

306
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,360
Speaker 0: I think it's really interesting.

307
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,420
Speaker 0: It came up because, again, not scripted.

308
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,060
Speaker 0: The whole conversation is not scripted.

309
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,760
Speaker 0: Not scripted.

310
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Speaker 1: By the way, sorry.

311
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,360
Speaker 1: Tell your guests, sorry.

312
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,240
Speaker 1: It's not scripted.

313
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,860
Speaker 0: Because it goes.

314
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,700
Speaker 0: No, it's totally fine.

315
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaker 0: I think that's what the beauty of this conversation is.

316
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,640
Speaker 0: Because it connects to what we talked before.

317
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,900
Speaker 0: We don't want to be vulnerable.

318
00:37:32,780 --> 00:38:42,980
Speaker 0: and it's understandable to be vulnerable to become open like to share any truth effectively makes you open and to share any truth you have to be open but to be open also means to be vulnerable so that's why we created the shields of lies like just generally relying about our feelings we're liking about ourselves relying about um like about everything like the modernity is basically an age where lies a virtue like that's one way of describing it which in my opinion is very sad and the proper feast as well as the proper fast ironically because the point one of the point of a fast has to become true with yourself like to look deep in your heart uh through let's say through limitation and you can say then the feast is a way to look deep into your heart through excess and to become vulnerable is still through an excess because you're sitting with your friend and suddenly your friend is basically publicly sharing his love towards you and uh it's a mixed feeling it is a mixed feeling for a prideful man like because on the one hand You don't know how to react.

319
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,700
Speaker 0: At least we as modern people, we don't know.

320
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,460
Speaker 0: Maybe it was different in the old world.

321
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,100
Speaker 0: Maybe it was way more natural.

322
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,800
Speaker 0: But I think to an extent it was even back then.

323
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,640
Speaker 0: We always like to pretend this false modesty is a form of self-protection.

324
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,380
Speaker 0: But then suddenly this vulnerability shows up.

325
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,360
Speaker 0: And it's a moment of truth.

326
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,800
Speaker 0: Because in truth you are vulnerable.

327
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,220
Speaker 0: And I think that's what you've been talking about a lot.

328
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,420
Speaker 1: I love this idea, this question.

329
00:39:10,620 --> 00:40:09,780
Speaker 1: because i don't know and you don't know either because we live today and there has been a shift in the way that human beings see themselves our anthropology about ourselves the story is different i'm an animal with a rational mind whatever i am so fascinated with that question is um because in georgia i still see it i'm going next week and i'll see it again um you'll see someone gush i don't know you know that word gush their their words are um almost effeminate with praise and it's very weird because I feel just as you described like stop enough it seems though the men that I like the most in Georgia this isn't all people by any means but the men I like the most they seem to exhibit something old which is like yeah I know what you're doing you have to do it and I'm not going to dishonor it by acting like you should stop because It's not about me.

330
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,820
Speaker 1: It's about you doing the right thing.

331
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,500
Speaker 0: Isn't that weird?

332
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,020
Speaker 0: It makes sense, but it is weird for us.

333
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,540
Speaker 0: That's why I would put it this way.

334
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,600
Speaker 1: It's odd.

335
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:27,900
Speaker 1: It goes back to that idea of being a proper guest, which is I'm going to allow your words to flow over me because I know what you're doing.

336
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,440
Speaker 1: You're offering the meal.

337
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,520
Speaker 1: You're offering the feast to me.

338
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,360
Speaker 1: So I'm not going to reject your feast.

339
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:46,440
Speaker 0: maybe also but that's the thing and maybe i will accept it in a sense maybe this actually reveals me more about me than i thought i am or like something i thought i want to be wow

340
00:40:47,860 --> 00:41:05,900
Speaker 1: this is the best idea right which is it's not false see i think at least i was trained to hear that as as it's it's it's excessive and dangerous in that it it could engender pride somehow I think that's true.

341
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,400
Speaker 1: I do think that's a spiritual danger.

342
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,420
Speaker 1: It's about the construct of the table.

343
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,180
Speaker 1: It's like you're meant to do it now.

344
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,000
Speaker 1: It's like you're invited now.

345
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,800
Speaker 1: The rules are such where the feast is inviting you to do it now.

346
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,300
Speaker 1: And you should.

347
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,520
Speaker 1: And I think we need times like that in life as human beings where we praise people that way.

348
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

349
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,920
Speaker 0: Because it's exactly this point.

350
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,040
Speaker 0: You brought it up.

351
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,700
Speaker 0: There is a time and place for it.

352
00:41:34,960 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 0: like that's the thing it's the time and place to reveal the truth and like if you're revealing this truth and even if a person is generally bad but he's not completely bad if somebody genuinely gives him this honor then he did something good in his life and it's not the cause of pride if anything i think to an extent to a truly prideful person like even boasting person to be in a proper ordered feast is still challenging because guess what it won't be just about him he will see people praising other people ironically it will actually bring him down but in an honorable way you

353
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:36,800
Speaker 1: see that too at our events where you joined you have to sit around and hear all the other praises and it can be difficult I know what you mean especially for a proud person no doubt you know when I struggle you know when I struggle For people who don't know anything about this, we run a restaurant, so we invite people to these dinners.

354
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,540
Speaker 1: And the dinners have this, they're super, they're Georgian.

355
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,280
Speaker 1: But sometimes I sit at the table, not as the Tamada.

356
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,400
Speaker 1: Do you know I struggle?

357
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,780
Speaker 0: I believe.

358
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,980
Speaker 0: You want to do it the right way.

359
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,680
Speaker 0: Like, oh, no, you should have done this.

360
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,940
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, you should have done that.

361
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,360
Speaker 0: But you really like forcing yourself.

362
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,180
Speaker 0: It's his.

363
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,080
Speaker 0: It's his.

364
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,840
Speaker 0: It's not mine.

365
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,240
Speaker 0: It's his.

366
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,920
Speaker 0: That's right.

367
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,900
Speaker 1: That's right.

368
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:01,920
Speaker 1: It's pride.

369
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,020
Speaker 1: It's fascinating.

370
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:11,240
Speaker 1: I love this talk because I really do think in the end, the royal path has to include both.

371
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,660
Speaker 1: And the royal path is peace.

372
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,160
Speaker 1: As the Georgians say, it's a piece of soul.

373
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,840
Speaker 1: And when you have it, you begin to give gratitude and thanks to everything.

374
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,180
Speaker 1: And I just feel like we've lost track a little bit.

375
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,500
Speaker 0: I actually think that's one important element to it.

376
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,600
Speaker 0: which the word you mentioned, I just want to stress it, the gratitude.

377
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,400
Speaker 0: I think, again, both in fast and feasting, you have the gratitude element.

378
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,580
Speaker 0: The fast is more like internal gratitude, if you want to put it this way, silent gratitude.

379
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:53,300
Speaker 0: And feast is, let's say, external gratitude, open gratitude, but still gratitude because we live in an age where we give thanks all the time.

380
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,200
Speaker 0: It's part of the common politeness.

381
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,860
Speaker 0: And again, I'm not talking about other people.

382
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,840
Speaker 0: I will just take myself.

383
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,880
Speaker 0: It's hard to be grateful.

384
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,600
Speaker 0: It's not easy to be grateful.

385
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,040
Speaker 0: Because you rationalize it.

386
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,700
Speaker 0: You think, well, I did this, I did that.

387
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,020
Speaker 0: Or it happens through my own merit.

388
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,620
Speaker 0: Stuff like this.

389
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,760
Speaker 0: Most of the thing.

390
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,020
Speaker 0: But true gratitude also is a moment of vulnerability.

391
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,440
Speaker 0: Because I'm admitting that I myself is not enough.

392
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:55,200
Speaker 0: I am me only through... like these people around me or people in my past or maybe people in my future ultimately through god but still you again putting yourself in through gratitude you're putting your place in a way of hierarchical manner and during the proper feast the gratitude is precisely flowing it is the flow of gratitude all around and this gratitude opens up and reveals and makes the truth and challenges it but that's why it's possible but that's why it's not boasting it's not even that's right what's the word for it?

393
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,620
Speaker 0: It's not like hypocritical.

394
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,840
Speaker 0: You're not lying to a person.

395
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,060
Speaker 0: You're sharing the gratitude and you're being honest.

396
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,720
Speaker 0: So that's a proper way of doing it.

397
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,940
Speaker 0: That's what I just...

398
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,000
Speaker 1: That's right.

399
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,180
Speaker 1: Well, gratitude in the end, I think... I've had this thought and I want to give it to you and tell me what you think.

400
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:58,080
Speaker 1: I think part of the problem is in history, we've never really seen... a nation and i'm not saying that we see one now maybe some in europe that are thoroughly atheistic because i've had conversations with atheists about to whom to what how does an atheist a true atheist there's very few true atheists in the world but there's some maybe how do they give gratitude and to whom the question i guess i'm asking you is do you think as a philosophical exercise do you think you can be grateful if you don't believe there is ultimately a creator

401
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:29,760
Speaker 0: to an extent but ultimately it's very challenging i think it is very challenging to put at least like ultimately not but i think it's really hard for people to truly believe that there is no creator deep like i me personally think most we kind of again tend to lie to ourselves like because i think ultimately if you sincerely believe into this you know full-on bulletproof materialism you should and uh your life is like nature like come you and not it's a good way but at least these guys were honest i would put it

402
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,700
Speaker 1: okay there you go they were honest exactly yeah

403
00:46:32,880 --> 00:47:23,140
Speaker 0: so they were honest like and uh i just think we are having big lack of honesty when it comes to these matters and uh but to an extent we have the lack of honesty it's legitimately hard for us to be grateful like uh for for anything like truly because uh hey i think that's an interesting point like when you're in a proper feast often let's say the person who gives you gratitude like being with your friend your spouse your i don't know son or daughter you have a lot of things in your past between two of you like really a lot of things and none not all i bet none of not all of them are pleasant things And when this person gives you gratitude, it kind of almost invites you to simultaneously humility and forgiveness.

404
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:34,080
Speaker 0: So you're simultaneously kind of forgiving them for all of the bad things which happened between you because you're embracing their gratitude, like embracing their honor.

405
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:43,700
Speaker 0: But also, ironically, being this guest, you are in a position of power, ironically, because whether you reject or accept this honor.

406
00:47:44,300 --> 00:48:16,480
Speaker 0: so it's always delicate interplay happening and uh I would say organically it's supposed to be some internal part of us like the the very fact that we sit like already for an hour and rationalize this thing and talk about this thing says a lot about us that we kind of don't feel it intuitively like we live in an age where like we need to name these things like to even understand why and what is happening while like It's not how we were even 200 years ago.

407
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,120
Speaker 1: You may have made the most important point for me.

408
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,980
Speaker 1: I love talking to you.

409
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,960
Speaker 1: I always leave with good questions.

410
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:33,980
Speaker 1: I think you just raised one, which is it's so important that we have this conversation.

411
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,680
Speaker 1: The problem is that we have to have it.

412
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,820
Speaker 1: It's very odd.

413
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,040
Speaker 1: It speaks to the meekness that Christ talks about.

414
00:48:43,560 --> 00:49:08,840
Speaker 1: the meek inherit the earth because they're already closer to god without this conversation there's so much speaking going on right where they've already inherited the simplicity of god they don't have to go down this road i used to think those people were boring in fact if you go to west africa with me meek people are everywhere and i don't know if you've traveled

415
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,540
Speaker 0: but not to africa

416
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:21,620
Speaker 1: it's India is similar when I haven't been there, but people tell me, you know, this is the guy who, when you get off your bus, he runs up and takes your bags and takes it and carries it.

417
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,300
Speaker 1: It's constant.

418
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,500
Speaker 1: And you go, this guy's looking for money, but no, he's just moving your bag because you're the foreigner.

419
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,260
Speaker 1: And then you see it all the time.

420
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,920
Speaker 1: The image I have is of a hunched person, a simple person who's always helping.

421
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,520
Speaker 1: And those people you find all the time, at least when you travel in real old world places.

422
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,500
Speaker 1: Georgia is the same.

423
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:51,400
Speaker 1: And what I'm saying is, is they're not really debating about feasts and fasts.

424
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,300
Speaker 1: They kind of go to the wedding.

425
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,600
Speaker 1: They know how the wedding is supposed to be.

426
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,060
Speaker 1: They kind of go home and they say their prayers.

427
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,500
Speaker 1: They know how the prayers are supposed to be.

428
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,200
Speaker 1: And we put everything up in our heads, which is fine.

429
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,360
Speaker 1: It's very interesting.

430
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,700
Speaker 1: It's a little like porn.

431
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,100
Speaker 1: It's exciting to talk about it and think about it and move it around.

432
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,380
Speaker 1: But it can get pretty awful.

433
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,420
Speaker 0: It can get pretty awful.

434
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,840
Speaker 0: And it's always a question whenever you make a public talk.

435
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,080
Speaker 0: And I know you make public talks yourself, so you're familiar with the danger of this boat.

436
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,180
Speaker 0: I still think we not have to.

437
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,880
Speaker 0: There is still good fruit.

438
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:57,760
Speaker 0: in this type of conversation again nowadays but i definitely like acknowledge and admit that this conversation itself is the sign of illness and not the sign of health ideally like this type of truth or processes we are talking about kind of should be self-evident it's very ironic to talk about with american about self-evident because you know you hold these truths to be self-evident and stuff like this but well Yeah, I know.

439
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:05,140
Speaker 0: And many, many capital T truth, actually, which are supposed to be self evident or not self evident, at least not for us.

440
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,520
Speaker 0: And to an extent is a humility to admit it, and to try to rediscover it.

441
00:51:11,260 --> 00:52:00,480
Speaker 0: And that's what I think, like, moving to the final part of a conversation, I think it's just a sign of our age, like, and I think it's, in a way, a very unique challenge, again, not to, you know, to tinkle the pride of ours but just admitting what the reality we live in a very unique age where nothing we can take we can rely on nothing for granted i will explain what i mean for most part of history uh people were naturally organically part of a tradition they didn't have to make a choice i'm born here it's the way it is like that's what the faces i go to church every sunday or something or like i like God sends a child, I have a child, a man goes to war, man goes to war, and man dies in a war, and I became a widow, or whatever.

442
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,120
Speaker 0: But all these things were natural, organic.

443
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,940
Speaker 0: Even if I don't really want to do it, I don't have to think whether I want to do it.

444
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,940
Speaker 0: I just do it because otherwise, yeah, sometimes brutal.

445
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,540
Speaker 0: Otherwise I will be ostracized and kicked out of the village, and I don't want to die in a forest.

446
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,580
Speaker 1: That's the motivator.

447
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,780
Speaker 0: Pretty huge motivator for people, historically speaking.

448
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,520
Speaker 0: Well, we live in a age where every choice becomes conscious.

449
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,000
Speaker 0: Well, you need to choose your face.

450
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,880
Speaker 0: You can't just rely on your parents' face.

451
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,200
Speaker 0: You need to choose your spouse.

452
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,440
Speaker 0: You can't rely on your parents or clan to pick up a spouse for you.

453
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,160
Speaker 0: You need to choose, like, especially huge choice for women nowadays, you need to choose whether you will be a mother or you won't be a mother.

454
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,240
Speaker 0: Again, it's not like our ancestors were that much virtuous than us.

455
00:52:42,520 --> 00:53:12,840
Speaker 0: I love them dearly, but facing the... challenges and choices we have nowadays i like again and i speak because i have the case of russian revolution you know russian we've been really proud of being the orthodox country for millennia but then what revolution came and 80 percent just like okay well it was part of the thing and it never came into a heart like effectively like it was part of culture but it never came into a heart we had a lot of people to whom it came to her heart and like last week we had the feast of matters like new martyrs of russia like

456
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Speaker 1: oh yeah that's right that's right yeah my daughter is named after one of the new murders

457
00:53:18,000 --> 00:54:41,540
Speaker 0: yeah but the idea is like so it was a moment of revelation and if i have to look into you know not constructive but providential importance of our time generally speaking is the end of modernity is it is a moment of revelation like everybody everywhere in almost every country to an extent that is touched by modernity has to choose again you have to choose again like what you believe in it where you stand and to our conversation you need to choose to feast you need to choose to fast you don't have to like there is no societal pressure on you like there is nothing pushing you towards it but you need but if you choose it it's upon you and that's why to an extent and i know maybe you have a different opinion that's why i think from a weird point these feasts you're throwing in america are to an extent more valuable and deeper than the feasts which are thrown in georgia precisely because of this because people who come to this feast and people who now throwing the feast stuff like around the country or to an extent even in modern russia i know exactly the same because it's still it's a willing choice to reject the atomization it's a willing choice to do something which is uncomfortable it's a willing choice to do the thing which you think is right even you don't truly understand why it's right and that values a lot i i think there is something about it

458
00:54:42,100 --> 00:55:12,940
Speaker 1: well it goes to the greek to remember to put back together again which is really the the role of every human being it's it's not like i reject and i know you do too i reject the idea that the enlightenment was a special kind of human fall that that leads us now to eternal perdition yada yada uh i do think it's a it's a special kind of worldview that's pretty rare in human history.

459
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:19,380
Speaker 1: You don't see a lot of that happening in the Enlightenment and individualism, you know, Cartesian anthropology and all that.

460
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,080
Speaker 1: You don't see that.

461
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,100
Speaker 1: But I will say this.

462
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:33,140
Speaker 1: There's something going on right now that our little group of folks who borrow this Georgian tradition, it's not Georgian.

463
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:57,820
Speaker 1: What I mean by that is it is exceptionally, as you said, it is an exceptional foray into being healthy it's just a human act of trying to be hospital hospitable and we're just using the georgian form um in part because of circumstances of our lives yeah because it's important

464
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:54,900
Speaker 0: because it's good like it's a very good form like and it's exactly the structural element of tradition but that's always the danger with tradition and that's why uh that's why in a way i i guess what i want to say i do understand why we ended up with modernity because we took tradition well it sounds a little bit big but correct me if like you think i'm going too far but effectively the reason always inherent danger and tradition to become for his sake if you want to put it this way just naturally happens because and again it's not just a tradition is bad but it's like by through creating order there is always inherent danger to just keep a form without substance like it's just nature we cannot live without the form but there is always danger in the form to replace the substance and then stuff like enlightenment or modernity effectively comes as a punishment like in a way providentially it comes as a flood as a punishment

465
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,380
Speaker 1: that's interesting

466
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:21,180
Speaker 0: you value your own form let's see how truly you value your own form when you forgot it what is the substance is when i present you with a true temptation well we see the outcome and what you see now it's exactly trying to take a good form but to take it precisely as a form and putting the substance in a focus which is if you want to say i think it's exactly the point of let's say history we are in like

467
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:38,900
Speaker 1: you know we tested it um by we started to get nervous because people really liked the restaurant and we were doing very well and we all felt the tamadas there who were americans that we felt perhaps we had pulled it too far afield.

468
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,380
Speaker 1: You know, on the left, they would call this cultural appropriation or something like that.

469
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 1: So I never felt that, but I began to wonder.

470
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,600
Speaker 1: And so we went back and we found Georgian.

471
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,520
Speaker 1: She's a historian of the Supra.

472
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,560
Speaker 1: And we interviewed her.

473
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,940
Speaker 1: You can see it on my podcast.

474
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,260
Speaker 1: And what she did, essentially, without being too melodramatic, is she just checked.

475
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,340
Speaker 1: each box we feared with, don't worry.

476
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,180
Speaker 1: You will be led by God.

477
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,920
Speaker 1: And if you're honest, then you will have a proper supra and you will not mock our Georgian traditions.

478
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,680
Speaker 1: But other than that, I have no advice.

479
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,720
Speaker 1: She made us aware that you have a blessing.

480
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,480
Speaker 1: It was like a bishop's blessing.

481
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,120
Speaker 1: She's done many papers on it and studied Georgian tradition.

482
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,000
Speaker 1: And so for us, it was enough.

483
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:42,520
Speaker 1: And just to say, go forward with a good and honest heart and you're not really appropriating anything you're you're remembering that which has always existed you know

484
00:58:42,840 --> 00:59:35,380
Speaker 0: yeah well i think this word remember might be the key remember is definitely it's i think it's better than choose again so i think the meaning behind is kind of the same so remember or choose again but point being and that's the spirit of age we're living in and uh it's both for difficult things in one form and difficult things in another form like everything is effectively becoming difficult when you're trying to remember things which like again as a matter of it's pretty simple imagine you your leg fell asleep but it fell asleep for let's say 30 years it would be really hard to start working on it again like it would be really hard to start working on it again but that's effectively what we are trying to do with our like spiritual health and spiritual soul And the extent is different depending on the context, but the general pattern is the same.

485
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,660
Speaker 0: And that's what I think.

486
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:41,880
Speaker 1: Can I maybe, we don't have to end, but I have a type of ending.

487
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,820
Speaker 1: Can I toast you?

488
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:43,800
Speaker 0: Perfect.

489
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,020
Speaker 1: But it's going to be in that flattering kind of way.

490
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,440
Speaker 1: So I want to say, for people listening, this might be something like one of the toasts.

491
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,600
Speaker 1: There was a moment in my life.

492
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:13,280
Speaker 1: where we took a chance to have a party and make that party into something like a supra, a Georgian supra, and then invite people from around the country to come and pay to be a part of it so that we could raise money.

493
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,520
Speaker 1: And I was very afraid no one would care.

494
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:26,860
Speaker 1: And then out of the blue came two Russian Ukrainian Eastern people named Andrew and Pavel.

495
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,720
Speaker 1: You came, see, you have to sit for the flattery now.

496
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:39,480
Speaker 1: You came in the night in a way that I, you were unannounced.

497
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:49,400
Speaker 1: I knew something was happening, but I didn't know what, because the moment you took to your first toast, I said, someone has invited a Tamada.

498
01:00:50,700 --> 01:01:31,980
Speaker 1: And from that moment on, we've been friends, not because you were a good Tamada, but because you dared to embody, this spirit to remember it and out of the blue show up with people you don't know and now because of that you and i and others have built many other rivulets of beauty and so i want to toast to the the moment that we call the unknown into which we must walk and with love and you did and so to you brother gagimarjos cheers The good news is, is I didn't have to be, I was sailing from my heart.

499
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,440
Speaker 1: So thank you, brother.

500
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,740
