1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,120
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,540
Speaker 0: Okay.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,300
Speaker 0: Hello, dear audience.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,060
Speaker 0: Today, I have a special guest, which I would like to invite you to participate in our conversation with.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,980
Speaker 0: This guest is John Hears.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,600
Speaker 0: And John is one of the most welcoming persons I've ever met.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:38,680
Speaker 0: He is one of the best hosts in the most general meaning of the world host, like both as a podcast holder, both as a tamada, which we will talk about it later.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,240
Speaker 0: And he's my dear friend.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,180
Speaker 0: So welcome you.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,000
Speaker 0: I would like to welcome you on my channel.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,680
Speaker 1: Well, it is a joy.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,280
Speaker 1: We got a lot to talk about.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,760
Speaker 0: Exactly.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,980
Speaker 0: And what I want to talk about today, generally speaking, is connected with the season.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,320
Speaker 0: So we are recording this conversation.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,300
Speaker 0: This conversation several weeks before Lent.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,240
Speaker 0: And this year is a special year when Lent starts more or less the same for all denominations.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:22,900
Speaker 0: And that's why I think it's a really good occasion to talk about feast and fast and the interesting dance that happens between these two phenomenons as on all levels of reality.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,340
Speaker 0: But I want to start with more joyous thing.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,800
Speaker 0: Like so.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,380
Speaker 0: A feast on feasting.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: John, how would you describe a feast?

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,220
Speaker 0: What is an essence of a feast and why it matters nowadays?

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,320
Speaker 0: How would you say it is?

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,120
Speaker 1: I start with my spiritual father in the Russian tradition of Rokor.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,260
Speaker 1: He was sitting with me.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,760
Speaker 1: This is when I was a young Orthodox Christian, a convert from Protestantism Episcopalian in the United States.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,800
Speaker 1: And he said he was with two other single guys.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,380
Speaker 1: And we're talking about my potential wife.

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,320
Speaker 1: And I was very, the best way to describe it is I was serious about my faith, maybe to a fault.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,180
Speaker 1: I was zealous.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 1: And I was very interested in if she could do it, be Orthodox.

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,180
Speaker 1: And he said, but I want to ask you a question.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 1: How does she feast?

35
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,160
Speaker 1: And I was like confused.

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Speaker 1: But how does she feast?

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,440
Speaker 1: What does it look like?

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,900
Speaker 1: And I didn't know the answer.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:54,200
Speaker 1: I had never really talked about the importance of sacrifice as toward a proper communion and the outcome being a beautiful family through the dedication to Christ.

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,360
Speaker 1: And we could go on and on.

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 1: But I had never taken this question.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,820
Speaker 1: Seriously.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 1: And it was during this time period that I left.

44
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,560
Speaker 1: I didn't marry this woman.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,760
Speaker 1: I went to Georgia, the Georgian Republic, where I got trained in hospitality and Orthodoxy.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 1: Long story short, I think the answer is that a feast is the intimation of heaven.

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Speaker 1: And the intimation of heaven is the ultimate, it's how we know hope.

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 1: And so I don't understand.

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 1: I understand people who don't naturally gravitate toward feast as the ultimate moment of hope.

50
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,260
Speaker 1: And so now there's drunkenness, guilty.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,540
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of guilty.

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,360
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of problems with the feast, but there's all kinds of problems with the fast.

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Speaker 1: And so I think it's true.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,720
Speaker 1: Just what happens when people hope is that they want to set a table.

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Speaker 1: They want something to overflow.

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,580
Speaker 1: And in Orthodox theology, it's Pascha, right?

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,360
Speaker 1: And Christ isn't contained in the grave.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Speaker 1: So there's an overflow.

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,480
Speaker 1: And the Georgians taught me there should always be more on the table than you can eat.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaker 1: And for an American ear trained in efficiency and pragmatism, it doesn't make sense.

61
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Speaker 1: It's like... There's too many remainders.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Speaker 1: You know, two plus two is four.

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
Speaker 1: Why do we have all these remainders?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 1: And I think the nature of the feast is to have excess.

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,900
Speaker 1: Because there's no reason we should have excess, Pavel.

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
Speaker 1: I'm interested in you as a philosopher.

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,660
Speaker 1: What is the philosophical explanation of more than we need?

68
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,340
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about that?

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
Speaker 1: It's a very hard question to answer.

70
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,100
Speaker 0: It is.

71
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Speaker 1: You know, like God exists as more.

72
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,100
Speaker 1: God exists as beyond.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Speaker 1: And so in some ways, the nature of our existence is the beyond.

74
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,020
Speaker 1: We are meant to have more than we can imagine.

75
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,640
Speaker 1: And the feast is an intimation of that.

76
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker 0: Well, I never thought, truth be told, about this in a way, like in a philosophical manner.

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,660
Speaker 0: But your question brought several associations, which I will share and we'll see where it goes.

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:45,920
Speaker 0: First, I think during the feast and more, it's a very good reminder is that any movement, per se, like any movement, generally speaking, in physical reality or in a human social reality, is a consequence of a form of desire, like, and so you desire something, you move towards what is desirable.

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,500
Speaker 0: So in a way, the desire creates movement.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Speaker 0: And the tricky part about it, we don't even think about it properly.

81
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 0: On the one hand, a human desire is insatiable.

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,640
Speaker 0: One can say so, like, it's never truly enough, but it's almost never truly enough in our imagination.

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,220
Speaker 0: It's like almost in illusions, in simulacrums, if you want to put it this way, in virtual reality.

84
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,380
Speaker 0: Whenever we face you with real reality, suddenly you're surprised, you almost always have enough.

85
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,920
Speaker 0: You have enough of human communication.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,460
Speaker 0: You have enough of human interaction.

87
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,440
Speaker 0: You have enough of food.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,340
Speaker 0: You have enough of water, et cetera, et cetera.

89
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Speaker 0: So, but ironically, like if we're talking about a little bit, I think, theologically, the logical aspect to it, God is something which is never enough.

90
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,360
Speaker 0: Like you can definitely, so it's something which is, always keeps feeling the one who desires it.

91
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,580
Speaker 0: So it's one, I don't remember which holy father said, but effectively it's never ending movement.

92
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Speaker 0: Like it's never ending the movement of desire.

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,640
Speaker 0: I think it's kind of similar in Dante's allegory, like of heaven, like that there is a constant movement around the sun or something like this.

94
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
Speaker 0: So in a sense.

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,660
Speaker 0: In an.

96
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:23,660
Speaker 0: An excess in a good feast, like in a, I will, I will highlight in a good feast, a feast, which purpose is not to get drunk for the drunkenness sake, but in a feast, which is a purpose, which is ordered to a higher purpose is to remind us that we still have a gigantic work to do in a heart expansion exercise to actually be capable of desiring more of a good things and being capable of keeping them.

97
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,660
Speaker 0: That's what kind of thought, which hit me like when you ask the question.

98
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:37,880
Speaker 0: I think it's, I think there is sort of connection here, like, because we're so trained in ironically, like we're trained both neither in excess knowing moderation, I would put it this way.

99
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:51,500
Speaker 0: We're really trained in this very awkward flat line gray zone, if you want to put it and any breakage of this great zone is equally challenged.

100
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Speaker 0: I just recently been with a good friend of ours, which.

101
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,440
Speaker 0: Been to art of.

102
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:12,800
Speaker 0: That's what I kind of thought struck me there is that I think it's not a coincidence that in a culture of the new world, as you describe it, it's equally challenging for us to fast and to feast.

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,140
Speaker 0: And that's, there is some very interesting direction in happening here.

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:17,900
Speaker 0: I don't know.

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,540
Speaker 1: You think philosophically it's played out in the role of the guest and the host.

106
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:23,820
Speaker 1: So.

107
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 1: One of the drawbacks.

109
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,120
Speaker 1: I call them light people.

110
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,220
Speaker 1: And so this is my sub stack and other places where I like to try to express.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

112
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,020
Speaker 1: Good.

113
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,420
Speaker 1: The light people is a play, of course, on enlightenment, but also on this category called whiteness.

114
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
Speaker 1: And we can get into that.

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,880
Speaker 1: I'm not sure that that category is real.

116
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,700
Speaker 1: I think it exists mostly as a modern phenomena.

117
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,200
Speaker 1: But.

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:08,040
Speaker 1: It's just like people are folks who have been trained to imagine in a Cartesian way that the answers are all found in, in, in our discursive thoughts.

119
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:19,040
Speaker 1: And there's something about the feasting that I've done and been blessed to be a part of, which is often Georgian, but not just Georgian lived in Africa, West Africa, East Africa.

120
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,900
Speaker 1: There's something about the intimation of eternity when someone is sitting you down.

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,480
Speaker 1: And giving you so much that you start to feel uncomfortable.

122
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,580
Speaker 1: Now, a light person feels uncomfortable.

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,420
Speaker 1: Let me try to explain this.

124
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,800
Speaker 1: I want to play around with this for me.

125
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,720
Speaker 1: A light person.

126
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,880
Speaker 1: Let's call them a modern murder of the enlightenment, European enlightenment.

127
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Speaker 1: There's something about us that we're taught to be self-sufficient as an act of goodness.

128
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Speaker 1: It's like.

129
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,760
Speaker 1: Because I am self-sufficient, I am also good.

130
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,100
Speaker 1: Which, of course, is not a Christian narrative at all.

131
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:16,000
Speaker 1: So when the host starts to act like God, and I find this in Islam, too, when I live with Muslims, when the host starts to present like a God, in other words, it's more than you can imagine.

132
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,400
Speaker 1: It feels like they're giving from even from things they can't give from.

133
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,380
Speaker 1: In other words, they're poor.

134
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,380
Speaker 1: And yet they they lavish you.

135
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,960
Speaker 1: A light person.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Speaker 1: A light person starts to feel very uncomfortable.

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,700
Speaker 1: At least I do.

138
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,180
Speaker 1: I'm one of those people.

139
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,580
Speaker 1: I'm always trying to be less of one.

140
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,460
Speaker 1: But I'm not saying they're bad.

141
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:35,960
Speaker 1: I'm not saying.

142
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Speaker 1: But the enlightenment has problems.

143
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,440
Speaker 1: So let me ask you a question.

144
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:51,600
Speaker 1: And if any of these presuppositions are correct, when I start to feel bad, I'm not playing a proper role of the guest, which is the acceptance of the grace, which is exactly the same role.

145
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,600
Speaker 1: Between God and I. If I imagine.

146
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:04,380
Speaker 1: Myself as self-sufficient, which is a bit of a Protestant theology, then I can imagine that myself is sort of equal to the host, the host being God.

147
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,700
Speaker 1: Now, I have a I have I'm a disordered.

148
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,000
Speaker 1: I'm a disordered guest.

149
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,880
Speaker 1: I haven't come to receive.

150
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,880
Speaker 1: I've come to add to my host.

151
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,940
Speaker 1: I find all of this very interesting.

152
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,300
Speaker 1: I think it's all tied up feasting.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,520
Speaker 1: I don't I don't always know how we can work it out.

154
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,760
Speaker 1: But there's something about the role of the guest in our world in the West.

155
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,840
Speaker 1: That is not allowed a proper feasting because we don't allow the host to be truly a host.

156
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,180
Speaker 0: What do you think about that?

157
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,620
Speaker 0: I think I think you actually touched a very deep point, very deep illusion.

158
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,800
Speaker 0: We all share as guests and we're in a way all guests to the feast of life.

159
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,860
Speaker 0: If you if you let me this metaphor, I think it's an illusion of control.

160
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,760
Speaker 0: I think it's an illusion of self-control.

161
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,560
Speaker 0: Like we want to believe and to act as if it's.

162
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:25,020
Speaker 0: It's true that we are in control of our lives and the trick is we are, but not in the way we think we are like you're in control it you are in control of your life precisely no matter you can be a good guess that's upon you you're in control of your life and then like the way you order your heart like you can really like that's highly upon you like the way you exactly push your heart expand your heart move beyond this, you know, like it's even you know.

163
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,820
Speaker 0: bastardized and you know pop psychology like get out of the comfort zone, but in a way it is get out of your comfort zone

164
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,900
Speaker 1: just like right it's built on something true that concept

165
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:55,860
Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so and this true concept is like we have this illusion, which we build this wall surround ourselves is optimization, because at least within this wall, I believe I can control everything that happens and nothing bad can happen to me, or if it's happening bad it's because I'm bad or something like it's the result of this illusion.

166
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,020
Speaker 0: Right.

167
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:13,640
Speaker 0: It's the result of my lack of control, and it's Rufus as you've been talking is a challenge exactly to this if you're coming because of like ideally if you're coming as a guest you don't know what you will be served like exactly like you, maybe some most general understanding but you don't know exactly what you will serve like you don't know who exactly will be there, like,

168
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Speaker 1: how long, how long,

169
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:24,780
Speaker 0: you don't know how long it's gonna take all these small details but you are not in control, you're part of this thing, but you're not in control of this thing.

170
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,300
Speaker 0: Right.

171
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:38,160
Speaker 0: And it is challenging legitimately like for us, like, it can be really really challenging so I think it's connected with this idea of control and but then the life itself is not controlled you don't control whether you're sick or.

172
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,380
Speaker 0: This is it.

173
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,800
Speaker 1: It really does.

174
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,360
Speaker 1: It does speak of the integration of theology with pregnant with practical life, which is what I really appreciate by a lot of these guys on the internet now, who are managing to take.

175
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,200
Speaker 1: It really does speak of the integration of theology with pregnant with practical life, which is what I really appreciate by a lot of these guys on the internet now,

176
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,180
Speaker 0: who are

177
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,520
Speaker 1: managing to take your one of them who are managing to take very difficult ideas that seem to be far away.

178
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,340
Speaker 1: And really relate them to our everyday existence, because this also will speak to how we meet our neighbor right.

179
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,820
Speaker 1: In other words feasting and fasting is also about neighbor to neighbor relationships, because I got to talk to sky.

180
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,900
Speaker 1: How long do I have to spend with them.

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,760
Speaker 1: There's this attitude we always need to get back to what I can control.

182
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,900
Speaker 1: I think it's a major.

183
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,460
Speaker 1: I think it's a major.

184
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:41,120
Speaker 1: I would not even say a major problem what I would say is is that the core of what people in the West are now clamoring against, but I don't think they would name it a lack of feasting and fasting or I don't think they'd name it an inappropriate guest host relationship.

185
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,720
Speaker 1: I think they name it economics.

186
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,700
Speaker 1: They would name it like opportunity.

187
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:45,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

188
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,480
Speaker 0: You know, and I hear I think absolutely great I think it's first I really want to not defend.

189
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,200
Speaker 0: Well, I think I would say.

190
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 0: not defend west in that respect not not because i like but just the problem is not in the west stories etc i think the like proper way of understanding is modernity and yes west kind of created modernity but then it kind of spread around the whole world and it became common let's say if you wanted a common poison if you like if we are borrowing the basically c.s lewis's language he called it commonly poisoned like basically we bruised the poison but the poison became spread around everywhere so i think it's just more correct talk about it's in this form because it's not the western problem like unfortunately like i wish it maybe part of my wish i could say no i

191
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,240
Speaker 1: think you're

192
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,520
Speaker 0: right i think

193
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:41,740
Speaker 1: it's a better way to describe it as uh modern and pre-modern or or enlightenment and pre-enlightenment yeah

194
00:15:41,780 --> 00:18:01,660
Speaker 0: kind yeah that's just more intellectually clear what we are talking about and uh this idea of exactly neighbor and atomization again in the pattern of feasting and fasting it's exactly the same pattern which breaks this idea of a modern man because modern man is not truly alone but he is neither truly social like if you consider the feast to being the pinnacle of communion like a true communion you know like the like exactly jo love jointly spread like love spreading around all the members of community and desires spreading all around of the members of community everybody cares about each other in the table like do you want this do you want that or a little bit more of this like stuff like this and faster than a proper let's say proper individualism if you want to be put it this way so it's a place when i limit myself when i introspect myself when i go into the depths of my heart then it's exactly two opposites of exactly the spectrum which modernity rejects both because we kind of want to be neither we don't want to be truly in communion but we also don't want to be truly in ourselves like modern man finds loneliness truth be told unbearable that's why we need all the sound around us like we need to constantly some sound in our ears and some some visual stimulation some audio stimulation so like everything's a true fast is against but we need it because we are not truly like we are nice amongst the people of the house no sociality no love or no move between both so that's some time of a hermetism and then some time of a lordship and then it's kind of flow continuity but it is challenging and just that's what i find very interesting like

195
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 1: well i used to think um so i'm interested in your take i know you're you're often speaking about orthodoxy

196
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,220
Speaker 0: how would you

197
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:41,880
Speaker 1: how would you categorize orthodoxy uh obviously it's a religion it's a worldview it's a it's a it's an epistemology it's a way of knowing so let's let's just say when i adopted that orthodoxy as a as a hope as a type of glasses through which to see just kantian but let's just leave it like that for

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
Speaker 0: a minute yes okay um i've

199
00:18:44,600 --> 00:20:05,760
Speaker 1: been i i started i've been wanting the the whole i've been wanting the jester and i've been wanting the communion because as a as a modern person before orthodoxy i got all the characteristics of an individual i i was rewarded by being a good individual in the way that the west rewards individuals and i've been trying to shed but it's it's it's a little bit discon it's a little bit disingenuous because i'm creating false dichotomies as i go okay and the the true the true orthodox person is integrating the two oh yeah they're not fighting one against the other and even when i do my podcast i catch myself and there's a reason i catch myself is because it's fun to juxtapose old and new it's fun to be a battler and it's fun to um it's interesting anyway to create really articulate opposites but i'm learning as i got older as an orthodox person my job is integration and and so in some way feast and fast is an integration right into what we've always meant to be so pavel the and i always say your name the way i say it but it's kind of it's kind of how people

200
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,880
Speaker 0: it's the way you love it don't worry

201
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,420
Speaker 1: so guess what though the prodigal does not return he returns to his father but he returns to a feast

202
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,380
Speaker 0: yes

203
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,980
Speaker 1: you have to remember that the father says yeah yeah

204
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:57,520
Speaker 0: yeah the feast is created for his return absolutely yeah it's it's like because feast is an ultimate goal i would say all images of heaven are not about fasting like it or not it's about feasting like and all the symbolism is about feasting it's the fast is a preparation for the feast like the fast of anything it's precisely the period so you can appreciate the feast more like it's something which makes the feast stronger but i think it is very important again in the context of land uh because land is a complicated topic topic nowadays i think i will a little bit derail and then come back because i think it is related

205
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,760
Speaker 1: uh

206
00:20:59,100 --> 00:23:02,920
Speaker 0: what we what we miss nowadays is uh that historically speaking land was always kind of organic process like it wasn't you know set of special rules like very complicated rules to follow or like very you know this neat picking of like can i actually eat this or can i actually eat this or like does this count or does this not like it was more or less organic again like the exact set of rules we most commonly tend to use nowadays were actually created in a very particular historical context in a very particular communities actually mediterranean communities and mostly for monks and it's kind of became easy especially in other regions to then forget what is the purpose and especially since we moved into the age of abundance because historically like let's say not eating meat was not that much of a challenge for people because simply you eat meat only when you celebrate there was not simply even an idea of like you just eat every day like so it was so the rules were reflecting the bigger point and nowadays i think it's really important to rediscover the point i think if you want to put it this way not really hidden it's not hidden it's in the open but something we kind of tend to often overlook behind the rules like the point of all of us is to prepare yourself for the feast and that's just i think is a big area of a conversation of talking about it or explaining about it like not explaining just talking about it effectively to start because then it makes sense why like that what is the land is what's the purpose of the land is the purpose of the land is not to have a dietary restriction like that's just very clear but in modern day and age because far away from this organic world which whatever the rules were created it looks very artificial and like often in like you know families when one member is orthodox and another is not orthodox it's actually well and challenging to explain why this is included and this is not included like it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense are you vegan or you're not vegan you know this type like what what are these rules for

207
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:31,600
Speaker 1: what do you think of the move though many modern churches um orthodox still try to go by whatever the rules have been and the catholics say okay pick something pick something and don't eat it on friday or pick something and don't eat it don't eat chocolate there's there's a mechanism for individual choice or something and is that an attempt to wrestle with modernity and

208
00:23:31,660 --> 00:24:42,280
Speaker 0: i definitely think it's an attempt to wrestle with us in modernity and i will be open i don't have a universal great answer for it i think what is ultimately important almost answer will be parish by parish base truth betalt like or something like this like because like ideally it should be based on a personal relations almost between to an extent priest and like you know as a parish member like there should be that general guideline and we definitely have a general guideline but the emphasis is definitely and i think i'm witnessing it more so definitely emphasis is becoming more in a spirit like like we need to make the let's say the technical rules more order towards the spirit of the christian church and not just the spiritual what's the spirit of the spirit of a fast and that's where i think feast is coming from because that's where i think uh almost the challenge for fasting is nowadays is that we are not feasting again i promise that i think this dual relationship is the key because unless you have this big abundant excessive moving beyond all of their ordinary borders feast at the end of a fasting period it almost doesn't make sense to fast like ironically speaking

209
00:24:42,660 --> 00:27:38,280
Speaker 1: like you're speaking i love this thought let's let's let's play that out for a second want to get a little let's let's let's i'll share something um uh as the tamada so the tamada is a georgian let's we gotta stay on this topic because i go all over but i want to stay on this because i'm gonna bring it right to it right now but tamada is a georgian toast master and i've been adopted by georgians and i've adopted everything that they do um and in terms of throwing this party called the supra and we do it at a restaurant as you know and you've been it was a wonderful time it was so it was good so good to feast with you so but here's what's happened is i've i've been hosting a lot of people at the restaurant not not not even not tens and tens but hundreds and hundreds common americans who come in and want to feast with you and i've been hosting a lot of people at the restaurant not not not even a feast in this georgian tradition it's very unique and i met a lot of young people and something's happening it's very interesting um there's like a neutrality of sexual desire so you didn't think i was going to go there but i want to go there there seems to be even among secular people that i talk to they'll come in with their boyfriend there's something like a friendship that is pre-dating that's the wrong word but pre-dating the sexuality of their attraction in other words they're friends in a neutral way and not thinking about sex and so why i bring this up because you said you really need to know how to fast in order to to feast in order to fast and you made me think that there is a weird thing happening in society right now where it's like let's ignore the edges let's ignore the fast and the feast and let's ignore the fast and the feast and let's ignore the fast and the feast and let's get right down to this royal path and it's like these these couples are ignoring the beauty of the feast which is the sex of a married couple right um and they're trying to go right to this middle place of friendship as if it was a moral like a moral good and therefore then they don't also fast then they don't have to fight the desire to not be with each other for instance i don't want to be with each other i don't want to be with each other i don't want to be with each want to sit on a couch with a woman and date them for year after year because the joy in some ways is the feast which is the sexual relation you see what I'm saying and this which would imply then that I get to be around her but as a faster and so as anyone who's fasting knows you don't sit around and fry up chicken and sit there and make all the most delicious meal and then don't eat it that's very weird and so I want to throw this to you it's

210
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,900
Speaker 0: torturous

211
00:27:39,560 --> 00:28:15,940
Speaker 1: it's torturous but what I've noticed is I wouldn't call them ascetics see this is what's so weird this is what I'm trying to say I'll say it's doing these tables have introduced me to non-ascetic ascetics people who practice asceticism without it being ascetic in other words there is no fat feast that they're trying to avoid and I think it's very unhealthy I think it's much healthier if we lived with more passion and more with more feasting passionate for the for the desire for the thing and more fasting I don't

212
00:28:16,100 --> 00:29:51,920
Speaker 0: know no it makes a little sense and and that's actually well let's go deeper but I think it's exactly the same pattern of life and death because any life is a product of movement the only place when there is no movement is the movement of death and this proper asceticism is aimed ultimately towards life one way or another as an abandoned feast literally or an abandoned feast when let's say monks start seeing energies it's like it's better than a fist it's not like it's not abstract it's more like sensual according to what we know it's more sensual even in the indescribably intense and you're a good a good feast is so it's this but more and more purified etc but it's this like or we can say that feast is a this but you know you know it's more down-to-earth form so that's a proper monasticism but the quasi monasticism you are talking about and I definitely see it a lot like let's be honest in myself or like people around me like it's this exactly the desire of neither so it's a desire of stability the lack of movement because it becomes an interesting part because in any proper host and guest relationship so in any movement there is always a hidden danger it's always a double-edged sword yes so a certain bravery is required to be a life if you want to put it this way a certain bravery is required to be with a woman a certain bravery is required to be a guest and I guess and that means we're just very covered people like modern man is a very covered thing

213
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:47,640
Speaker 1: this is you put the words to what I was trying to say which is there's these beautiful people by the way people are beautiful they have simply included the possibility of the sword of the danger you're absolutely right and somehow I want to pat him on the back as a father of daughters but I don't think it's a good thing because it it leads the man into a place of there's some sort of weakness in not being able to admit the danger of your manhood to your girl um I I desire the the feast and so I can't lay on your couch all night like I really like that's very Also very old world very and very Georgian and I think Russian if you go back in time and

214
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Speaker 0: any traditional like Serbian but German French doesn't like any traditional culture

215
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:18,700
Speaker 1: any tradition where the man is meant to be in the presence of a woman and burn in ways that only he knows because he's so strong but he he would admit to a burning he would admit to a fire and a fight within himself if asked especially by other men but by the woman he would simply either yeah remove himself or he would move toward marriage and of course or other things

216
00:31:19,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Speaker 0: yeah but but that's the thing yeah it's exactly still the pattern like at least the recognition of a desire and taking responsibility for this desire one way or another which also requires bravery and again we're coming to this point of kind of false comfort again sorry it really sounds both the way i wanted but it kind of is a false comfort because it's kind of like even in like 20th century russian songs like couple very popular one uh basically there is this line like if you if you are not living you don't have to die something along this line so in in a way like you can say that this cowardness is also related to this fear of death because both feast if you say that feast is this image of life in its fullest like an image not life in its fullest but it's an image of life in its fullest and fast is an image of willing full spiritual death to come back to life let's say to go like into the desert and to go into the grave to an extent and then to come back to life then this is kind of in between it's constant limbo like if you want to put it this way it's a limbo like and the limbo became such a norm for just as you can call it even a spirit of time the spirit of time is a limbo then that's

217
00:32:46,260 --> 00:33:21,200
Speaker 1: good that's very true it's a spiritual limbo i do think i do think we're in a but i do think we're in an age of i do think there's desire there's greed but spiritually i do think it is it's an empty time but it's being filled up it's it's being filled up by the you know the powers and the principalities of post-modernism but also by christian there's a christian narrative that's returning i think all over the the modern world

218
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,440
Speaker 0: um

219
00:33:23,960 --> 00:34:45,639
Speaker 1: what will it become it's a really good question you made me had a thought can i share it with you about about i think i get into this a lot um this philosophy of the table and of feasting and i love it i think i want to really write a book about this but i want to say this to you what i noticed about the georgian supra which by the way can happen three or four times in a week so i just want you to know that like uh we know families in georgia that they're not trying they're not like on friday big party it it builds on itself so the mother and the auntie will cook and then the guests will come over and then another person and it just sort of happens um but it happens and this is what i wanted to share it happens with order and i think a proper feast has elements of the fast yes and and so much like monasticism you would never say it's always a fast if you go to a monastery there's great even in even in a funeral you feel bright sadness there's there's always a hint of joy in in a monastery and at a proper feast at least i would argue the georgians have done as well as anyone in history doing a proper feast you wouldn't see it at a round table if they can avoid it there might be a round table but the round table implies some sort of equality and democracy

220
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,760
Speaker 0: instead

221
00:34:47,820 --> 00:35:34,660
Speaker 1: you're going to see a long table with a head the head is usually a toast master who calls everything to attention you you wouldn't be very odd to have a tamada that doesn't call the table to attention the odd table and at the other end of the table is usually the oldest male which is a sign of it's like a bookend sign of you know god the father god the son bishop and there's all this order and there's order in the toasting but there's a major consumption of wine which is the ultimate right in many ways for many people that's the ultimate expression of a feast but the georgian table you drink a lot but it's like not the point to drink a lot the point is to honor a lot or to be in a constant state of of of honor and and offering honor and

222
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:46,620
Speaker 0: and vulnerability just just being my memory that's i think very connected sort of gone but maybe you can connect the vulnerability and honor as a pair like we rarely think about this way

223
00:35:47,180 --> 00:37:01,900
Speaker 1: let me do that because it's really it's really true um someone a dishonorable person let's just say a dishonorable person approaches you and in that approach you sense something like dishonor the last move at that point is for you to be vulnerable you'll immediately begin to meet his his perceived dishonor with some sort of guard or attack and so at a supra when it's most beautiful is when the tamara is most honorable because he provides a he provides a safe place for the vulnerability of his guests and they know that when they act in a vulnerable way through a toast about their mother or something that was sad to them the tamada will protect them with his honor and you see tables that go sideways you see fat feasts that go sideways are when the table demands that the tamada not enter as an authority figure but rather sits on the side and then you see a lot of dishonor and but you also see a less dishonorability

224
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:15,160
Speaker 0: um it's i think it's it's really interesting like that it came up because again not scripted the whole conversation is not scripted not just yeah just by

225
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 1: the way sorry tell your guests sorry it's not scripted because

226
00:37:21,620 --> 00:39:06,220
Speaker 0: it goes now it's totally fine i think that's what the beauty of this conversation conversation is because this uh it connects to what we talked before like we don't want to be vulnerable we don't want to be vulnerable we don't want to be vulnerable and it's understandable to be vulnerable to become open like to share any truths effectively makes you open and to share any truths you have to be open but to be open also means to be vulnerable so that's why we created the shields of lies like just generally we're lying about our feelings we're lying about ourselves we're lying about um like about everything like the modernity is basically an age where lies is a virtue like that's one way of describing it which in my opinion is very sad and the proper feast as well as the proper fast ironically because there's a point one of the point of a fast has to become true with yourself like to look deep in your heart uh through let's say through limitation and you can say then the feast is a way to look deep into your heart through excess and to become vulnerable it's still through an excess because you're sitting with your friend and suddenly your friend is basically publicly sharing his love towards you and uh it's a mixed feeling it is a mixed feeling for a prideful man like because on the one hand you don't know how to react like I don't know at least we as a modern people we don't know maybe it was different in the old world and maybe it was way more natural but I think to an extent it was even back then it's all we always like to pretend this false modesty is a form of self-protection but then suddenly this vulnerability shows up yes and it's a moment of truth so because in truth you are vulnerable like and that's right I think that's what you've been talking about a lot

227
00:39:07,120 --> 00:40:13,100
Speaker 1: I I love this idea this question because I don't know and you don't know either because we live today and there has been a shift in the way that human beings see themselves our anthropology about ourselves the story is different I'm an animal with a rational mind whatever I am so fascinated with that question is um because in Georgia I still see it and I'm going next week and I'll see again um you'll see someone gush I don't know you know that word gush their their words are um almost effeminate with praise and it's very weird because I feel just as you described like stop enough it seems though the men that I like the most in Georgia this isn't all people by any means but the men I like the most they seem to exhibit something old which is like yeah I know what you're doing you have to do it and I'm not going to dishonor it by acting like you should stop because it's not about me it's about you doing the right thing isn't that weird

228
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,720
Speaker 0: it's totally it makes sense but it is weird for us that's why I would put it this way it's

229
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:34,360
Speaker 1: it's odd it goes back to that idea right of being a proper guest which is I'm going to allow your words to flow over me because I know what you're doing you're offering you're offering the meal you're offering the feast and so I'm not going to re I'm not going to reject your feast

230
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:46,440
Speaker 0: and maybe also but that's the thing and maybe I will accept it in a sense maybe this actually reveals me more about me than I thought I am or like something I thought I want to be wow

231
00:40:47,860 --> 00:41:28,520
Speaker 1: this is the best idea right which is it's not false see I think at least I was trained to hear that as as it's it's excessive and dangerous in that it it could engender pride somehow that I think that's true I do think that's a spiritual danger it's it's about the it's about the construct of the table it's like you're meant to do it now it's like you're invited now the rules are such where the feast is inviting you to do it now and you should and I think we need times like that in life as human beings where we praise people that way

232
00:41:29,100 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 0: I do absolutely like because it's exactly this point you you brought it up like there is a time and place for it like that that's the thing it's the time and place to reveal the truth and like if you're revealing this truth and even if a person is generally bad but he's not completely bad if somebody genuinely gives him this honor then he did something good in his life and it's not the cause of pride if anything I think to an extent to a truly prideful person uh like even boasting person to be in a proper ordered feast is still challenging because guess what it won't be just about him like he will see people praising other people if anything it's like ironically it will actually bring him down but in an in an honorable way like also you

233
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:29,160
Speaker 1: see that too at our events where you where you've joined right you you have to sit around and hear all the other praises and uh it can be difficult I know what you mean especially for a proud person no doubt no doubt yeah you know what I struggle thought about you know when I struggle yeah

234
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,000
Speaker 0: yeah

235
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Speaker 1: uh for people who don't know anything about this

236
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,740
Speaker 0: um

237
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:46,400
Speaker 1: we run a restaurant so we we invite people to these dinners um and the dinners have this they're super they're Georgian but sometimes I sit at the table not as the Tamada do you know I struggle

238
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Speaker 0: I believe you want to do it the right way like oh no you should have done this so you know you should have done that but you really like forcing it's his it's his it's not mine it's his yeah

239
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:25,180
Speaker 1: that's right that's right pride it's fascinating yeah I love this talk because I really do think in in the end the Royal path has to include both and the Royal path is peace as the Georgians say it's Shvidova it's a piece of soul and when you have it you begin to give gratitude and thanks to everything and I just feel like we've lost track a little bit

240
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:46,700
Speaker 0: it's okay I actually think that's one important element to it which is the word you mentioned I just want to stress it the gratitude I think again both in fast and fisting you have the gratitude element the fast is more like internal gratitude if you want to put the silent gratitude and fist is let's say external

241
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,480
Speaker 1: that's right

242
00:43:47,560 --> 00:45:04,940
Speaker 0: gratitude open gratitude but still gratitude because we live in an age where we give thanks all the time it's part of the common politeness but and again I'm not talking about other people I will just take myself it's hard to be grateful it's not easy to be grateful like because you rationalize it you think well I did this I did that like or like or it happens through my own merit or you know stuff like this most of the thing goes through but true gratitude also is a moment of vulnerability because I'm admitting that I myself is not enough like I am me only through like these people around me or people in my past or maybe people in my future and ultimately through God but still you again putting yourself through gratitude you're putting your place in a so good in a way of hierarchical manner and during the proper feast the gratitude is precisely flowing it is the flow of gratitude all around and this gratitude opens up and reveals and makes the truth and challenges it but that's why it's possible but that's why it's not boasting it's not even like what's the word for it it's not like hypocritical you're not lying to a person or you're like you're sharing the gratitude in corners so that's a proper way of doing it I guess that's what I just

243
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:58,080
Speaker 1: that's right well gratitude in the end I think I've had this thought and I want to give it to you um and and tell me what you think I think part of the problem is in history we've never really seen a nation and I'm not saying that we see one now maybe some in Europe that are thoroughly atheistic because I've had conversations about to whom to what how does an atheist a true atheist and there's very few true atheists in the world but there's some maybe how do they give gratitude and to whom the question I guess I'm asking you is do you think as a philosophical exercise do you think you can be grateful if you don't believe there is ultimately a creator

244
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:29,760
Speaker 0: to an extent but ultimately it's very challenging I think it is very challenging to put at least like ultimately not but uh I think it's really hard for people to truly believe that there is no creator deep like I me personally think most we can again tend to lie to ourselves like because I think ultimately if you sincerely believe into this you know full-on bulletproof materialism you should and uh your life Isaac like Nietzsche or like Camus and not it's a good way but at least these guys were honest I would put it

245
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,700
Speaker 1: okay there you go they were honest exactly yeah

246
00:46:33,180 --> 00:48:16,860
Speaker 0: they were honest like and I just think we are having big lack of honesty when it comes to these matters and uh but to an extent we have the lack of honesty it's legitimately hard for us to be grateful like uh for for anything like truly because uh yeah I think that's an interesting point like when you're in a proper feast often let's say the person who gives you gratitude like being with your friend your spouse your I don't know son or daughter you have a lot of things in your past between two of you like really a lot of things and none not all I bet none of not all of them are pleasant things and when this thing this person gives you gratitude it kind of almost invites you to simultaneously humility and forgiveness so you're simultaneously kind of forgiving them for all of the bad things which happen between you because you're embracing their and also ironically being this uh guest uh you are in a position of power ironically because whether you reject or accept this honor so it's always delicate interplay happening and uh I would say organically it's supposed to be some internal part of us like the very fact that we sit like already for an hour and rationalize this thing and talk about this thing says a lot about us even in age where like we need to name these things like to even understand why and what is happening while like it's not how we were like an even 200 years ago like

247
00:48:17,540 --> 00:49:08,840
Speaker 1: you you may have made the most important point for me well I love talking to you um I always leave with good questions and I think you just raised one which is um it's so important that we have this conversation the problem is is it's very odd um and it it speaks to the meekness that Christ talks about you know the meek inherit the earth because they're already closer to God without this conversation there's so much speaking going on right where they've already inherited the simplicity of God they don't have to go down this road I used to think those people were boring in fact if you go to West Africa with me meek people are everywhere and I don't know if you've traveled

248
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,540
Speaker 0: but not to Africa

249
00:49:11,600 --> 00:50:12,380
Speaker 1: it's India's similar when I haven't been there but people tell me you know this is the guy who when you get off your bus he runs up and takes your bags and takes it and carries I had it's constant and you go this guy's looking for money but no he's just moving your bag because you're the foreigner and then you you see it all the time it's I always I I I'm the image I have a hunched person um a simple person who's always helping and those people you find all the time at least when you travel in real old world places um George is the same and like what I'm saying is is they're not really debating about feasts and fasts they kind of go to the wedding they know how the wedding's supposed to be they kind of go home and they say their prayers they know how the prayers are supposed to and we put everything up in our heads which is fine it's very interesting it's a little like porn it's exciting to talk about it and think about it and move it around and but it can get pretty pretty awful

250
00:50:13,220 --> 00:52:14,300
Speaker 0: it can get pretty awful and it's always a question whenever you make a public talk and I know you you make public talks yourself so you're familiar with the danger of this boat like I still think we not like have to like there is still good fruit in this type of conversation again nowadays but I definitely like acknowledge and admit that this conversation itself is the sign of illness and not the sign of health ideally like this type of truth or processes we are talking about kind of should be self-evident it's very ironic to talk about with American about self-evident because you know you hold these truths to be self-evident and stuff like this but well yeah I know and many many capital T truth actually which are supposed to be self-evident are not self-evident at least not for us um and um to an extent is a humility to admit it and to try to rediscover it and that's what I think like moving to the final part of a conversation I think it's just a sign of our age like and I think it's in a way a very unique challenge again not to you know to tinkle the pride of ours but just admitting what the reality uh we live in a very unique age where nothing we can take we can rely on nothing for granted I will explain what I mean um for most part of history uh people were naturally organically part of a tradition they didn't have to make a choice I'm born here it's the way it is like that's what the faces I go to church every Sunday or something or like I like that's I a godson's a child I have a child a man goes to war man goes to war and man dies in the wars and I became a widow or whatever but all these things were natural organic like even if I don't really want to do it I don't have to know whether I want to do it I just do it because otherwise yeah sometimes brutal otherwise I will be ostracized and kicked out of the village and I don't want to die in a forest like

251
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,580
Speaker 1: that's the motivator

252
00:52:16,680 --> 00:53:12,840
Speaker 0: it's pretty huge motivator for people historically speaking well we live in a way to where every choice becomes conscious well you need to choose your face you can't just rely on your parents face you need to choose your spouse you can't rely on your parents or clan to pick up a spouse for you you need to choose like especially huge choice for women nowadays you need to choose whether you will be your mother you won't be a mother again it's not like our ancestors was that much virtuous than us I love them dearly but facing the challenges and choices we have nowadays I like again and I speak because I have the case of Russian Revolution you know Russian we've been really proud of being the orthodox country for millennia but then what Revolution came and eighty percent just like okay well it was part of the thing and it never came into a heart like effectively like it was part of culture but it never came into a heart we had a lot of people to whom it came to her heart and like last week we had the feast of matters like new martyrs of Russia like

253
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Speaker 1: oh yeah that's right that's right yeah my daughter is named after one of the new murders

254
00:53:18,000 --> 00:54:41,540
Speaker 0: yeah but the idea is like so it was a moment of Revelation and if I have to look into you know not constructive but providential importance of our time generally speaking is the end of modernity is it is a moment of Revelation like everybody everywhere in almost every country to an extent it is touched by modernity has to choose again you have to choose again like what you believe in it where you stand and to our conversation you need to choose to feast you need to choose too fast you don't have to like there is no societal pressure on you like there is nothing pushing you towards it but you need but if you choose it it's upon you and that's why to an extent and I know maybe you have a different opinion that's why I think from a weird standpoint these feasts you are throwing in America are to an extent more valuable and deeper than the feasts which are thrown in Georgia precisely because of this because people who come to this feast and people who are now throwing the few stuff like around the country or to an extent even in modern Russia knows exactly the same because it's still it's a willing choice to reject the atomization it's a willing choice to do something which is uncomfortable it's a willing choice to do the thing which you think is right even you don't truly understand why it's right and that values a lot I I think there is something about it

255
00:54:42,100 --> 00:55:57,560
Speaker 1: well it goes to the Greek to remember yeah to put back together again which is really the the role of every human being it's it's not like I reject and I know you do too I reject the idea that the Enlightenment was a special kind of human fall that that leads us now to the eternal perdition yada yada uh I do think it's a it's a special kind of world view that's that's pretty rare in human history you don't see a lot of that happening in the Enlightenment and individualism you know Cartesian anthropology and all that you you don't see you don't see that but I will say this um there's something going on right now that our little group of folks who borrow this Georgian tradition it's not Georgian what I mean by that is is it is exceptionally as you said it is an exceptional foray into being healthy it's just a human act of trying to be Hospital hospitable and we're just using the Georgian form um in part because of circumstances of our lives yeah because it's

256
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:54,900
Speaker 0: part because it's good like it's a very good form like and it's exactly the structural element of tradition but that's the danger of this tradition and that's why uh that's why in a way I I guess what I want to say I do understand why we ended up with modernity because we took tradition well it sounds a little bit big but correct me if like you think I'm going too far but effectively there is an always inherent danger in tradition to become for his sake if you want to put it this way just naturally happens because and again it's not just a tradition is bad but it's like by through creating orders there is always inherent danger to just keep a form without substance like it's just nature we cannot live without the form but there is always danger in the form to replace the substance and then stuff like enlightenment or modernity effectively comes as a punishment like in a way providentially it comes as a flood as a punishment

257
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,380
Speaker 1: that's interesting

258
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:21,180
Speaker 0: you value your own form let's see how truly you value your own form when you forgot it what is the substances when I see the outcome and what you see now it's exactly trying to take a good form but to take it precisely as a form and putting the substance in a focus which is if you want to say I think it's exactly the point of let's say history we are in like

259
00:57:22,140 --> 00:58:21,620
Speaker 1: you know we tested it um by we started to get nervous because people really liked the restaurant and we were doing very well and we all felt the tamadas there who were Americans that we felt perhaps we had pulled it too far afield you know on the left they would call this we are cultural appropriation or something like that so I never felt that but I began to wonder and so we went back and we found uh Georgian um she's a historian of the Supra and we interviewed her you can see it on my podcast and what she did essentially without being too melodramatic is she just checked each box with don't worry you will be led by god and if you're honest then you will have a proper supra and you will not mock our georgian traditions but other than that i have no no advice and she just

260
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,200
Speaker 0: she made us aware

261
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:30,360
Speaker 1: that you have a blessing it was like a bishop's blessing she's done many papers on it and studied georgian tradition and so

262
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:30,980
Speaker 0: for

263
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:42,520
Speaker 1: us it was enough and just to say go forward with a good and honest and heart and you're not really appropriating anything you're you're remembering that which has always existed you know

264
00:58:42,840 --> 00:59:36,660
Speaker 0: yeah well i think this word remember might be the key remember is definitely it's i think it's better than choose again so i think the meaning behind is kind of the same so remember or choose again but point being and that's the spirit of age we're living in and uh it's posed for difficult things and form and difficult things in another form like everything is effectively becoming difficult when you're trying to remember things which like again as a matter of it's pretty simple imagine you uh your leg fell asleep but it fell asleep for let's say 30 years it would be really hard to start working on it again like it would be really hard to start working on it again but that's effectively what we are trying to do with our like spiritual health and spiritual soul and the extent is different depending on the context but the general pattern is the same and that's what i think

265
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:42,820
Speaker 1: can i um maybe we don't have to end but i have a type of ending can i toast you

266
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:43,800
Speaker 0: perfect

267
00:59:44,520 --> 01:01:33,960
Speaker 1: but it's gonna it's gonna be in that flattering kind of way so i want to say for people listening this this might be something like one of the toasts um uh there was a moment in my life where we took a chance to have a party and make that party into something like a supra georgian supra and then invite people from around the country to come and pay to be a part of it so that we could raise money and i was very afraid no one would care and then out of the blue came two russian ukrainian eastern people named andrew and pavel pavel and um you came see you have to sit for the flattery now you came in the night in a way that i you were unannounced i knew something was happening but i didn't know what because the moment you took to your first toast i said someone has invited a tamada and from that moment on we've been friends not because you were a good tamada but because you dared to embody this spirit to remember it and out of the blue show up with people you don't know and now because of that you and i and others have built many other rivulets of beauty and so i want to toast to the the moment that we call the unknown into which we must walk and with love and you did and so to you brother gagi marjos cheers and the good news is i didn't have to be i was sailing from my heart so thank you brother well i will end

268
