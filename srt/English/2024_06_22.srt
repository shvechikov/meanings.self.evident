00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:21,380
Speaker 0: hello dear audience today it is a true special day for our channel we have a most wonderful guest a man who needs no introduction the one who basically revived and mass symbolic thinking in the west jonathan pedro

2
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,500
Speaker 1: thank you it's nice to meet you

3
00:00:26,740 --> 00:01:29,500
Speaker 0: and so today we have a quite a huge i would say broad list of topics we would want to talk about they will talk about problems of identity political community international order but where we want to start i think is one of the most basic elements of what's happening what is playing out in front of our eyes and i've been entertained the thought that all main let's say paradigms of thinking like liberalism communism at the nationalism which seems to be self-evident which seems to be dominant in the modern political discourse are in fact just the brothers uh fighting over that killed their own father of enlightenment and now they're just effectively trying over its inheritance and over its uh dead body since you made a lot of videos about this topic i would maybe like you to elaborate on like to say whether it's an overstretch or maybe it's not a deep enough understanding of the process

4
00:01:30,720 --> 00:04:59,660
Speaker 1: yeah well it depends on what angle you want to look at and so one of the aspects so the enlightenment obviously is a very broad it's a very broad event uh but one of the aspects of the enlightenment is related to let's say rationalism or to the creation of this of scientific processes or in some ways the fine-tuning of those processes and also making that type of thinking the analytical type of thinking uh you could say making it the mode of being that is preferred maybe that's a good way of saying it and you know that leads downstream to many things that you know when we look at them we find very positive like it increases obviously the capacity to quantify you know to name and to predict phenomena and therefore it leads to the type of scientific progress that we have seen but if you take that as a mode of thinking that's a way of you have to understand that you can't avoid the corollaries of that type of thinking so if you have an analytic mode of thinking where you try to create strong identities that you then analyze and predict you know you create these uh you know so it does things like for example the creation of encyclopedias right the creation of dictionaries all of this type of of attitude where we want to fix the phenomena define it create a very strong boundary around it so we can analyze it predict it and all that well that has corollaries which are the the problem for example of nation states so nation states are born out of that thinking and ethnic division the way that we think of them in the modern age are also born out of that division because just like we want to identify species of animals in order to analyze them and and look at their behaviors we do the same with humans and we do the same with nations so instead of having you know broad empires with fuzzy borders and you know and kind of no man's land and and ambiguous spaces we want to have nations with clear imaginal lines you know and we create maps and we have maps that are you know the ancient maps were basically just uh cosmic descriptions of relations of of of large you know uh like identities and so if you look at the t map for example in the middle ages you know it's like it's basically just europe africa asia in in like a flower pattern and it has nothing to do it has very little to do with the type of analytic thinking that we apply to the world now so and and like you said what how it happens is that has corollaries which is all the things that all the modern political movements are in some ways downstream from that whether it is the libertarian who wants to be completely autonomous and free from all relationship to to to other beings or whether it is the ethno-nationalist that wants to segregate himself and create this really tight clear identity border between the romans and the liberals who have a border around their identity you know or whether it is the the communist that in some ways is actually strangely akin to the libertarian though with a different strategy yeah uh but so you can see the downstream from this type of thinking you have all kinds of problems or political solutions that although they fight amongst themselves like you mentioned in at the introduction they are in some ways they're not in some ways they are just fruits of of the same origin

5
00:05:03,160 --> 00:06:28,920
Speaker 0: points which i would like to elaborate i guess i will start with a quick point i really like your idea of borders because i think it's one of the most fascinating uh element of modern reality when people treat borders as something both sacred fixed and natural whereas historically they've been never any of these three things effectively all borders in history are frontiers they're constantly moving they might not be completely flexible but there it's always a movable line like there is i think maybe one or few borders in the world which like lasted for hundreds of years and it's something like between border between a small duke of andorra and the rest of spain like in like peninsula but generally speaking borders are always something which is moved and i think that's kind of the core weakness of rationalist thinking which you i think we can address it now that it tries to freeze time all of these kind of process all of these ideologies they try to freeze time so let's say we find the perfect mapping of some of a moment being at the end of history of fukuyama like liberal end of history communist and then let's freeze it it won't go any further it nothing will ever happen so let's freeze these borders and when you ask the most simple question why these borders so why no movement then it falls apart like it just falls apart

6
00:06:29,540 --> 00:08:08,120
Speaker 1: because if you ask the question let's say in terms of nationalism let's say the nationalisms that developed uh very strongly at the beginning of the late 19th early 20th century you ask yourself oh okay so does that mean that now this is it forever like you said like we're just going to keep these lines forever uh and you can see it like in some ways there is a sense in which if you want to understand like if you want to understand let's say where the political movement is you can see you have to just have to look at where the borders are absolute and unquestionable and where the borders are all of a sudden treated as completely arbitrary and ridiculous and and as if not all the borders are actually have the same the same characteristic but when you you look at political movements you can notice that when all of a sudden they start to treat certain borders as arbitrary and ridiculous you think oh okay now i see where the wind is shifting i can kind of see but what's interesting about that is in some ways the post-modern reaction to the modern to the modern thinking is in some ways a a realization that identities have fuzziness right that identities have hybridity that identities produce these intermediary states that the modern rationalist wants to eliminate but you can't completely eliminate and so they they you could say that if you try to eliminate the fuzziness then it at some point it it has revenge on you because you you build it up in the in the borders then at some point it overwhelms the identity you can't you can't avoid it forever

7
00:08:09,540 --> 00:09:17,440
Speaker 0: i absolutely agree this revenge of the fuzziness it's a great phrase i will i might borrow because that is a paradox like those people who like i find it quite often mostly right now and this um i don't know how to call this movement let's say anti-gnostic anti-marxist movement in the west which is doing like quite a bit of educational work and it's remarkable but they keep missing this core element like at least most of them that what they're fighting against it's the consequences of the actions of their heroes it's like you brought it upon yourself and that's a very that's why i started the conversation from enlightenment because as you said so once you see a political community as something quantifiable named predictable rationalized you will end up in those areas like then you will have this revenge of a business and then just those who do it better than you will start eating you but it's still in fighting that as long as you don't address this foundational stones that political communities are neither quantifiable and predictable they are quite different in their nature

8
00:09:19,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Speaker 1: yeah and and i don't it's very difficult to see how we're going to solve the problem because it's like once you start to crystallize things right right once you start to make these these magical then you start to create because imagine a lion has no space between it so if you want to like let's say i mean i'm talking about nations but you can use this for any type of category right imagine a lion has no fuzziness and therefore who's gonna give like how are you going to recreate that fuzziness when it's the magic line is there it means that that you're looking at war all that you're looking at for at least the potential idea of war all the time because you've got these lines that are you don't have the kind of hybrid a hybrid buffer between the empire that you would have for example between the roman and the persian empire you know for example so it's a it's a problematic thing and so therefore what happens is the dream of abolishing the borders becomes almost necessary so that's why it sounds contradictory but the the rationalism and the desire to you know the let's say the analytic mode of creating all these nation states it ultimately also leads to a dream of a world world government like it leads to the dream of something like communism where the borders all dissolve because the problem of the borders is a real problem and if you if you ignore it then then you have world war one and you have world war two and it's like these are these are these are issues that the idea that that went away it's like we're not going to have that again it's so completely ridiculous as we see now

9
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,100
Speaker 0: uh

10
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:25,500
Speaker 1: but but then there's a dream of saying well then we should have all the borders dissolved right so this is the funny thing about you know the movement of the enlightenment and the movement of modernism is that because of its dialectical structure right it tends to do that and and that's in some ways i think that's one thing that people like hegel or marx intuitive intuitive rightly you know that that that process is in some ways inevitable for for for

11
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:34,380
Speaker 0: yeah as long as you have this foundation it is inevitable i think that and and it's but it's very hard to identify the foundation

12
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,160
Speaker 1: it's a false foundation oh for sure it is a false

13
00:11:37,200 --> 00:13:00,240
Speaker 0: foundation yeah it is but it became so natural it became self-evident and that's why we're having conversation like this to just effectively an exercise of as a way of thinking or like trying to identify this foundation as not self-evident that it is not like how it is or how it always been and your example of like historical borders roman empire like it's very interesting and core example this whole idea of margin flu this whole idea of fluidity on the border but we need to understand that this fluidity the disappearance of this fluidity exactly hasn't always been like you know a natural process of dying out again we cannot avoid talking about a political actor like a political subject a political sovereign who deliberately wanted to destroy this imperial fluidity and i think i i will i won't talk about it but i will i guess offer it right now the way i see the hierarchy of political communities and the way we see it nowadays and then where the kind of trick happens so in my idea is in my understanding on the bottom lies a classier in a broad scheme of things like you can call it a political community any local community but it is effectively community everybody knows that everybody supposedly love it like all this um productive multiplicity creative multiplicity not oppressive multiplicity like a church that's why i think a class is the best way of describing it

14
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,000
Speaker 1: and the class is that

15
00:13:03,420 --> 00:15:13,460
Speaker 0: a church no a church yeah okay a church a church sorry yeah the church and then on a second level of let's say imagination nowadays we are supposed to have something like nation state historically hasn't always been the case it can be called like a kingdom but uh so something of this level of analysis like let's something something that unites many classes together but it's big enough that's big enough to be to act in history something big enough to get to act in us to act enough as a sovereign and then there is a third level of imperium let's say of empire like this is something which is truly unifying and like is much stronger than all of those like uh kingdoms on their own and what we and the version of history which should say we are usually taught in the history books and was people to understand is empire is evil and oppressive and it oppresses its local communities local classes but in my opinion it's a trick because actually it's empire and ecclesia which are usually way more in a flexible if you read history books you will see how much flexibility how much gray zoning how much borderlining like it allows but what is the true ally is a nation state or let's say a small kingdom and what is even above and empire this tower of babel what i called or a globalist or a communist dream so alliance is happening between the steps but we keep but most people keep missing the structure and that's why they think that nation state for example is an ally of local community whereas historically nation state has never been an ally of local community historically all nation states are literally created on the bones and blood of local communities but they're sold in a history version as uh on the contrary something which fights to protect the local community from an oppressive empire whereas the true master is kind of states on the shade and it is this idea of tower of bible world without no borders so and that's what i think the paradox we're in and that's why it's hard to have a conversation because people rarely see this whole structure at least the way i encounter maybe you see it yeah

16
00:15:14,120 --> 00:18:45,060
Speaker 1: well i maybe i see i probably see it a little differently from you in the sense that the way that i see it is that what you have is you basically have you you need to have units that fit into other units right we all know that that's the way that you can't function that's the best way to function and that's the traditional way to function you know the ancient way to function you had to have things like family clans you know villages in like you said kingdoms or sometimes kingdoms that even had had uh you know aristocracies that were like local feats or whatever and then you move up into a kingdom uh and and then that let's move up into that kingdom and become a part of a of an empire uh like we saw during the roman empire or the you know obviously there are different forms of empire even the muslim empire or um and so that was was and so that was has been for i mean since the bronze age you could say the the traditional way of things to lay themselves out and it's almost inevitable that we do it that way the problem seems to arise to me when some people get there knowing that in those remember before the for example among us has to learn more about travel in that way um i'll go on to do my own stats to help me understand where it's going uh yeah you're right when i don't talk about then when i approach things then i start tiley go in so this is going to be objetive to try and smarten the kind of structure in which we have to build but just to give a long context there we look at intersect a handlar of an object or a region which is what you're doing著 street sits hide it have a Abgeordarradance which includes להתüğר and how to direct it 지금 from clubs and so you see all these stories which are obviously inevitable of abuse in families abuse in clubs abuse in churches all these things it's like oh the state will protect us and then what happens is you start to level the you start to level the the intermediary structures and then you create a kind of individual state relationship and that is corrosive like it's corrosive to the identity of the person uh and it's and it ends up ultimately making the state into a form of tyranny even without anybody willing it particularly because it has to take up in its own authority has to take up all those intermediary levels which which are not necessarily natural for it to do so now the problem is that technology makes that possible in a way that in an ancient empire you simply could not have done that right it's like the king could have said i want to control everybody in my empire but all right how are you going to do it because you don't have the reach to do it so technology makes that possible and it makes it possible to dream like you said like we talked about and i think a lot of people are kind of naturally moving towards that to dream of a universal like a universal state where now the globalist states will protect us from our nation state you know we that's the way that it's presented it's like oh those horrible dangerous ethno nation states that are you know that are that are xenophobic and they're all these things and we we accuse them of being xenophobic and they're all these things and we we accuse them of them and they do all these things that are only for their own interest we need a you we need a global interest we need something that serves everyone and so we're going to create this global structure that with technology will be capable of managing individuals here i mean that i mean that is the most like you said that's the most corrosive thing ever for tower and it is

17
00:18:45,120 --> 00:20:09,380
Speaker 0: the same pattern it's absolutely the same pattern and it breaks upon the same mistake because it's the way you've been describing like to protect individual effectively against its community but here is allies of false contradictions because i would agree even now like subconsciously to an extent we are still relatively healthy we leave a community like people don't live as individual we we say we do leave as individual we do claim we live us in tv but we don't really we always live in a community we always leave us in something which is bigger than the sum of its parts this this sum can never be truly properly quantifiable but as you said the very manner that the state treats an individual like let's say as something as exists on its own this famous empty board of law basically I think it's coming from effectively lock and hops like effectively in more in one way of thinking but exactly the same pattern is that so let's just take this nation states as individual units which historically they are not and then let's devoid them of all other things and then exactly uses bigger authority to protect again now individuals against the state but it is the same pattern and until you stop thinking about reality in terms of individuals which I think it's a really huge challenge it's really hard to start seeing like the other way of potential coexisting it's a little bit problematic well

18
00:20:09,480 --> 00:21:47,500
Speaker 1: I don't know if you read you maybe you haven't read it but but I wrote a paper last year for our on subsidiarity uh and in some ways for me this has been the thing that I want to bring about it like because I'm not a very political person I'm not a very political person I'm not a very political person I'm not political person I'm not a very political person I'm not a very political person person in my engagements like it publicly I I'm political privately like also in my own state but uh you know I've been wanting to help people see that this subsidiary model as the most natural model and how in some ways the false opposition right because one of the issues with the classical liberal is that they're they they tend to push towards the individual and the sovereignty of the individual but they don't realize that as you push towards the sovereignty in the power of the individual even though you don't like it you're necessarily making the power of the state more and more necessary because you need something to fill in the the subsidiary gaps of alignment right that are little communities and all these things that fit together to to create something that is more akin to a natural system so you have this opposition right where the individual becomes more and more free in parentheses and then the state becomes more and more powerful necessarily and that's why like the that's why the strange Coalition between rainbow you know Rainbow Coalition stuff and you and globalism because it looks how do these two things fit together would they completely fit together because as you move towards idiosyncrasy then you need the state so it's like the idiosyncrasy becomes more and more pervasive and therefore we need someone to protect all of us from each other right because now we all hate each other

19
00:21:48,340 --> 00:22:38,880
Speaker 0: it's the same yeah as ideal ideal in this idiosyncratic moment we have this famous optical image the one eye in the middle and every single individual in its own cell like that's the most famous image of uh that's what how where it cannot not go like there is no way of going it but kind of I think our audience knows it and I just want I guess to highlight the things which lead to this and I think we mentioned one important question in this paper or not some other of your conversation which uh liberals often don't get they consider any subsidiary arbitrary and it's not subsidiaries are not arbitrary and if you treat individual as a primary element of analysis then it has to be arbitrary then every subsidiary has to be arbitrary but it's not and then you run into the problem you just described

20
00:22:39,340 --> 00:23:30,060
Speaker 1: yeah because and it's funny because in some ways you know the the modern scientist type should be able to perceive this is that that it's it really is like natural systems the way that society functions because what you have is you have cells and those cells like they exist for the unity of a being right they don't only just exist on their own and so individuals have a level of existence but individuals don't exist without families they just don't exist they have no they have no way of being without being an interrelation with other people and so you necessarily need all of this to stack up right that's the way the best way to to see it and it's the most it's the most natural way for the world to to to exist it imitates all kinds of natural systems that we that we see in in biology

21
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,740
Speaker 0: uh

22
00:23:31,100 --> 00:24:29,120
Speaker 1: and if you're not careful you know you create the problem of fragility which it's which is exactly what globalism does because it was funny because of all people I remember I saw an interview with Elon Musk like in somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something some weird thing where they were asking Elon Musk like we need a global government like we need to move and Elon Musk was saying no you can't because if you do that then you just have one thing and if it falls then everything Falls you need you actually do need several empires and multiplicity because if one of them starts to decay then the other one will take up the space and you have this you have like a natural competition that doesn't necessarily have to just be seen as warring but rather as really like I said like natural systems and so if you only have one way of doing thing and only one pyramid if that pyramid starts to to shake then it then you have actually have you have an apocalypse you have an armageddon everything falls apart because

23
00:24:30,860 --> 00:25:28,000
Speaker 0: yeah i agree ultimately but yeah this idea of competition of different it's also just as any subsidiary model that especially in terms of politicals then you understand that there is a healthy limit to it like under certain moments there is a natural limit to it let's say that's why i'm talking let's say an empire is a natural limit of a particular subsidiary so yes any empire has this element of global universality i admit coming back from roman empire which considered to be the empire of the world as we know it but it's exactly more like an aspiration historically it's impossible for any political empire to become a true one global empire the ambition if anything is good because it makes them like to be better to exactly this whole this element of competition which um rationalists like but they never really ascribe to become this one controlling uh reason guardian which uh world government inevitably has uh to lean forward

24
00:25:28,680 --> 00:26:56,340
Speaker 1: but but in some ways we have to be the problem that we have the roman empire i i think i agree with what you're saying completely but we have a problem now which is that now we have technology that actually makes it possible so the roman empire couldn't like you said their aspiration to be in some ways the global empire you know that it was limited by their reach by their you know and when they overreached they paid the price for it because um you know they basically overreached their capacity to actually control these things yeah and then the mercenaries that they were using to continue to increase their their their their uh like reach finally said well i don't align with you i might as well just be a thing and now attack you know towards the inside but with this is the problem that technology makes it technology and ai and all these things make a global government actually possible uh you know but uh it's a very interesting point to come to that end because you know you don't need mercenaries you just need robots like i mean i know that that sounds you just need drones like you just need to have drones fly over everybody you know just kill it you just blow up a few houses once in a while to remind people we're watching you like an absolute authoritarian world government is yeah i don't know if it's possible but at least the dream of it is far more it is is closer than what the romans or the persians had access to

25
00:26:58,320 --> 00:28:02,660
Speaker 0: i i see what you i see what you mean and uh yeah it is definitely closer but i think here is a completely different pattern which is on our side i actually don't remember this line in english but do you remember when mary praises the lord in the second chapter in the second chapter of luke praises a lot and says that he dispersed the arrogant with the intention of it of their hearts i see i'm translating so maybe in english it sounds slightly different but i think that's effectively the same element which will happen in this story so their own they won't be defeated by this this idea to create an a the total idea secrecy on the tower of bible level and we can actually now talk a little bit about it as a symbol because i think it's a perfect example the very complexity of the structure is a very arrogance of the structure will be the root of its own demise it won't be the root device of like let's say counter-revolutionary movement no no revolutionary movement when defeat this tower but it will collapse on its own that's what i think will happen but until then we'll see

26
00:28:03,380 --> 00:29:21,520
Speaker 1: we have an example of it right which is the soviet the soviet empire collapsed on its own it's not like you know it although there there were you know americans and other people were trying to influence they were trying to do things in order to kind of bring it down but it didn't it didn't like you said come up with a counter-revolutionary movement it didn't come up with a counter-revolutionary movement it basically just petered out because the the amount of control that he the amount of control that it exercised of centralization was not sustainable and created lack of alignment fractally right so you know this is also the problem with the it's already it's already the problem with the nation-state which is that it's their responsibility it's not me i'm just a taxpayer a consumer i'm just a you know i'm not i'm not actually a member of a body i don't feel uh allegiance in the way that i care for my family i have an abstract allegiance maybe but you know and the only way that people are able to real to reawaken the uh allegiance to a state is war right and so you have war so oh now we're together now we're like you now we're this people and now we're going to fight this other people but if you have a global government what are you going to do i guess you need aliens you need extraterrestrials like you need alien enemies or something because then you just have basically just going to fight this other people and then you're going to fall apart because nobody is going to feel it

27
00:29:21,760 --> 00:30:41,360
Speaker 0: but that's why actually you can uh you bring this for the second time you wrote the question of four and i now i will indulge myself because speaking of like the theory for is one of my favorite topics to discuss honestly and it is not coincidental because actually the question of war is the question of this whole sovereignty because ironically if a state being at a nation state or an empire nation an empire state is not like like it or not but historically it's the right to wage war is the political right and when we after world war ii created this uh ape of united nations which says no there will be no wars like and like wars are illegal we don't allow any wars you can't exactly created the foundation for this next step and then why do you need states at all in a way on top of it you created the gigantic problem of hypocrisy because if you look into once again if you look into real history there was wars we just don't call them this way anymore like that's the most ironic thing like people often like it's it's remarkable that there is no worse like like what united states is in iraq it's not war what is happening between russia and ukraine right now it's not war legally it's not war and like there was no wars like for the last 70 years and it's kind of this example of this clown world you're talking a lot

28
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:54,620
Speaker 1: yeah but we're not idiots like you know we're not we're not i think that i think that if we're having this conversation we're we're not neither of you but the type of person that just listens to the drivel that comes out of the official sources and the same but it

29
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Speaker 0: is important i would agree this is important why even those in power don't call it why i think that there is an actual important seed in it because they don't treat themselves as properly sovereign and that so i i guess it to me it's a sign that a certain shift towards the bible has already happened like and it's happened like 70 years ago on a very fundamental level i guess so that was my

30
00:31:17,020 --> 00:32:12,820
Speaker 1: that's an interesting idea i never thought of that like it's an interesting idea to say that the fact that that nation states you know for example like the united states have basically been in war since world war ii non-stop it's just like the korean war the vietnam war you just keep like there's just a it just had they've been at war without without end and so but the fact that nobody wants to actually call it war is it that is an interesting idea like you said it means that even though it's hypocritical it means that we somewhat somehow everyone is accepted that the the capacity to wage war is no longer justifiable in any way like there's no justification for it and so what we do name wars right we do we do call them wars but it's not it's always it's not the the people the powerful agents you know they tend to avoid it

31
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:20,960
Speaker 0: uh it's gray zone it's always fluid it's war on terror it's a culture war it's uh like something else but yeah it's

32
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:36,260
Speaker 1: not we say we do say vietnam war like we do say korean war we do say the people they do say the war in iraq although i that's a colloquial term but for sure in the united states i don't think the u.s has voted for war i don't forget legally

33
00:32:36,360 --> 00:33:00,760
Speaker 0: like no historically as you know there is a very it was a very clear like act called declaration of war like it is a document like historically you needed to declare like that's a country a even in world war ii like this there is like like you can look like war in germany like there is an official state that since like 12 p.m this day we are in a state of war that's what i mean and this is gone like yeah yeah completely

34
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:44,880
Speaker 1: for sure now it's it's very it's gone and and also because the it a lot of it has to do with the way that that that america considers itself like its own self-identity identity and the manner in which it it wages it's constantly waging war for its interest but it it also um masks it in the interest of the people that they fight where they fight you know and in some ways sometimes i've always wondered if that is also a kind of remainder of a veneer of christianity right this veneer christianity where we have to we feel like we have to say no we're we're going in iraq you know because we want to help the iraqis like we're going in syria because we want to help the syrians yeah

35
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,800
Speaker 0: uh you

36
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:56,040
Speaker 1: know which is which is a very strange idea way of doing war but you said to be the way that that at least the modern west does war

37
00:33:56,720 --> 00:35:42,740
Speaker 0: uh it's not just but i can tell you it's not just the west that it generally became a global uh paradigm you can i guess you can argue that the united states maybe were one of the first who really cemented this model in their actions and this is very interesting like story and so on for an outsider the united states is definitely a very interesting case because i i based on my conversation actually believe is it doesn't change the fact that what they are actually doing is a normal historical power struggle etc etc you perceive it as a benevolent let's say acting in this realm of ideas and care but it doesn't change the fact that it is what it is in reality but there is this very interesting gap which creates with as here comes a big difference between the americans perceive themselves and the rest of the world specifically but um it's just very interesting uh topic but back a little bit because yeah unfortunately it's fascinating so i like i just wanted to come back to i think the issue of um cornerstone issues so uh because uh we talked about it like um uh different elements how it's not working so let's talk a little bit how it works i would to be a little bit more positive and one of the quotes of yours from one of again your videos which i loved it a lot like about what is a political campaign unity and the quote is that mysticism happens every time you encounter unity in the world and for me then there is a question so is it who not a world not a what or if that holds a political community together so it is mystical in nature and i guess i wanted to maybe you to elaborate

38
00:35:42,780 --> 00:38:59,220
Speaker 1: yeah why is it mystical in nature so i mean i think like you said like when you quoted it that you have to understand that the mysticism the experience of unity it happens you know way lower than the political sphere right it happens every time you you perceive unity because the because the qualities of the unit right like we say the whole is more than the parts right that something that has a unit unitary identity cannot be the the multiplicity of it the parts of it cannot account for the quality of its unity right that's what they call emergence you know whatever like that word that people use um but that kind of thing it's it's like that it's really a definition you know it is and then youVERY person is a right and and then there's a product that's feel like they're there because they're there because there's a way forward but right the logic is that when we perceive unity we're at every level that we perceive unity and then it's true as a person and so the unity of the person right the fact that i have a unity cannot be accounted for like my brain is a bunch of things going off my body is a bunch of things doing things but nonetheless i i have a a push want and so you can understand now like why families for example like that families in many cultures will have things like they had family gods for example or that they had patron saints or they had this this notion of a kind of guardian angel of the family because we notice the unity of the family coming together and you know we're made of a bunch of people but we can we feel that's just not a feeling but it is it is a capacity to recognize the unity and that scales right it scales into communities into parishes it scales into into uh you know cities like for example in italy during the middle ages it was the city state that was strong where people had or you know even during the hellenistic period people identified with their city their body politic and saw that as a having a common identity but they were still capable of seeing themselves as hellenes as having also higher identity that pulled them together into that type of common space and they had ritual ways of acknowledging and participating in that um and so that keeps on scaling uh and at every level there's always there's opportunity and danger and that's really important like i think even you know when we started the conversation i wanted to mention that which is that empire can be horrible a nation can be horrible families can be horrible and a person can be horrible and so it's important to acknowledge that into not to paint a simple rosy picture of these structures right you know julius caesar bragged that he killed a million gauls like he he was proud of doing that in order to bring them into the empire so these are horrible acts that all of these levels of power do but they also at the same time offer opportunities which are real and should not be denied as well you know and we shouldn't say well just the roman empire killed all these people so it's horrible the answer is yes but also the roman empire provided communication and peace amongst these people you know at the same time so we have to be able to see the good good and bad of all these

39
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:38,020
Speaker 0: and you need to judge the historical story it's this rosy like just because like before like i think two or three decades before uh julius started his uh whole crusade no not crusade whole like invasion in the goal as a goal came to rome and almost destroyed the rome so like it's it's it's it's not like you know there is a no it's not a one-way find a good peaceful guy in history basically you won't find a good guy who was just you know innocent uh peace-loving community which like no the moment you step into history you will do things which yeah yeah it's good it's good yeah so just sorry

40
00:39:38,060 --> 00:40:20,520
Speaker 1: i agree i agree no i don't i don't want to i don't want to like i said i don't want to paint either way as it's important to understand that but not so nonetheless what what happens is there is a type of mystical unity which is exhilarating and this is important for people to understand it it's exhilarating because you just like when you're in a sports team and all of a sudden you feel this unity right you're working together and you're winning the game and all of a sudden you feel this kind of sense of being elated into the identity uh and like again again that provides you provides opportunity but it also provides danger i mean it's like you can weaponize that in crazy ways which we saw in the modern in the modern nation state

41
00:40:21,620 --> 00:41:19,240
Speaker 0: exactly but okay then then just let's talk a little bit more about this danger because i think it's one of the things we are missing in our modern conversation is the distinguishing between two types of danger and i think a lot of let's say misunderstanding and manipulation happens here so one uh danger is in my in my understanding you can call it natural and yes i will reference christianity is just the consequences of sin sorry there is there is a danger in sin and as you said an individual family nation state et cetera et cetera et cetera it's uh the danger of uh i would call it you can call it natural entropy or basically something can go wrong all the time you are not perfect nothing is ever really perfect and uh one of the russian philosophers nikolai berzeev has this very i think important to hear now phrase that the state is not to create heaven on earth it's not to let it devolve in hell

42
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,320
Speaker 1: like so yeah yeah yeah so and you can

43
00:41:23,680 --> 00:43:35,180
Speaker 0: and you and you can argue it's also a pattern the point of yours is not to create heaven on earth it's not to let your soul in hell the point of the family is not to create let's say you know literally create heaven on earth but where manipulation happens if we forget looking about this admitting the well and it comes to rationalism and enlightenment because it kind of destroyed it forget to accept that we are limited and we do forget because we consider us first progressive and then we consider us to being this humanist man who is way better than everybody who has ever been before history really really started with us before there was only darkness where the light which come and then sorry that is the basic pattern of thinking oh yeah then you leave then you leave no room for imperfection then you leave no room for imperfection into anything and then you have to look to any authority figure to precisely destroy the imperfections which you are still witnessing because they are natural but you cannot accept the their natural cause so you have to you have to ascribe them exclusively to human-made causes like to those other causes you if anything create causes which explains imperfections around itself and that's one big conundrum happening and then of course there is a second conundrum you are talking about that there is an element of potential corruption in any structure if you effectively turn it to the wrong purpose that's another thing but they are different things but if you can at least address the second you can because we can talk about what is a good purpose what is the good dealers what is good what is so we can talk about it and maybe we can yeah try to through you know transforming the hearts education talking because it's very interesting that for the most part of history the political treaties and machiavelli was the one who broke the traditions they were not about how it works and how to gain power but what kind of person we need in power so what kind of heart should be that they make the decisions so how we educate the say the sovereign the monarch etc etc and we can talk about it so how not to let them to dissolve into this tyranny but it's not the conversation we are having the real conversation we are having is this uh labyrinth of fighting against imperfections which are irreducible and i think that was completely missed

44
00:43:36,060 --> 00:45:12,260
Speaker 1: that's a great i mean i think that's a great point uh you know uh interesting this is an interesting moment that i had because uh i i had a taxi driver a moroccan man you know nice guy living in canada uh talking about covid now in 20 after covered was over and in saying just how horrible it was in morocco because in morocco they didn't do anything like they didn't have mass they didn't have all this stuff and and i'm like listening to the guy and i asked him i said was there a difference in death toll in morocco and canada he said no not really like was there a difference in in the everywhere in canada i said a different sense but i had no idea if no question in morocco or it's not what what Ch headlights up was it just uh the injustice not and i answered her in the if and he's like no not really and i said and i was like so what's the problem he said well at least they managed it and it was like that's the thing it's it's this idea that what are you going to do there's a prop there's an imperfection in the system and you and this weird idea like you said that somehow we have this weird idea that now the state has to fill up this imperfection to this kind of Tower of Babel you know thinking whereas you know the the natural way of being would say to say yeah that's right you're right people die and people get sick and bad things happen and that part of life you know and and if we if we want the state to cover every single bad thing that happens we are setting ourselves up for tyranny like it's going to happen you can't avoid the corollaries of that authority in your life

45
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:23,340
Speaker 0: but also not just I think that's important to highlight it's exactly the pattern let's say if you want your family to cover up for any imperfection which you have on your own it's the same problem it's the same

46
00:45:23,520 --> 00:46:04,260
Speaker 1: problem you're right no you're exactly right that's that's that's the right way to think about it but even in your will like you have the same problem inside you which is that if you try to could if you try without like the guidance of of a spiritual father or someone helping you if you try to like get rid of all your sins you know you are in serious danger my friend because you are going to you're going to run in right into a wall and you know it's like people who try to establish crazy disciplines right or like dieting for example like oh I'm I have this problem like I'm gonna diet like crazy and then you know then you meet them a year later and they they've gained another 30 pounds because they collapse

47
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,480
Speaker 0: they are unhappy the only difference is they are now also very unhappy because they failed to

48
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,820
Speaker 1: to yeah and

49
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,200
Speaker 0: no that's

50
00:46:14,260 --> 00:47:26,660
Speaker 1: a good point that's a good point of the of the of the idea that in some ways to understand the state of the fall and to understand the need to acknowledge imperfection so you know you know there's this tradition in late middle ages it was called the nine worthies I don't know if you know about this political tradition so basically it was they you know the the thinkers in in the late middle ages had identified nine characters in history that were important and in some ways models so three from the pagan past three from the old testament and then three from the modern like the modern for the medieval era right and what they would do is they would say something like Alexander right Alexander is a great man he's a one of the worthies and they would say here are the great things he did and here are his sins and they would do that for all the characters and it was like now we have this weird idea right we can't we can't stomach imperfection and we can't stomach imperfection and we can't stomach imperfection in even our historical figures and so you see that in America people like tearing down statues because someone wasn't Jesus basically it's like oh he wasn't God so we have to destroy everything like every memory of them because they they weren't perfect which is which is nuts

51
00:47:27,280 --> 00:49:55,220
Speaker 0: well I think here happening like super trick honestly but like first thing it's not just about this nine worthy tradition I'm just like I'm running a class on Plutarch like from like my projects and then they read Plutarch like whenever you read any description of Plutarch it's like description of person like it's it's full of imperfection like it's worth it just and and that's the way people understood history actually for the most part of our like existence we understood history as stories and that was very clear it's a story of a nation if it's story of a person of course it will have failures but it can success us and failures it's like nobody expected perfection from anything we we claim what we and we learn from it that's important thing we learn from it like let's say in this situation he did this so maybe if the similar pattern arises in your life you know you are not the first one who encountered it this way of thinking is completely lost to us uh but it's not on but again it's convex there's a whole idea of freeze of time the nature because we simultaneously exactly we are the light before us was darkness like that's the basic pattern of thinking like nobody can think about past and anything but darkness but and people think that's why we are judging the past from the lenses of the present but I actually think that there is a trick happening and maybe you're like here's what we will say is that it's not like just with judging past uh from the perspective of a present we are protecting our present from being judged through the eyes of our past I think there is this trick happening because how how how it looks in practical would you like rather have your politician be like uh I don't know who is who was I don't know great Canadian parliamentarian of the 19th century so you're not familiar but yeah a person but point out or your modern politician yeah think about it yeah yeah the standards read the speeches read the language like simply read the speeches the way they speak in Parliament in 19th century like even in the 19th century not going let's say in the medieval but just read the way they speak and read the way it's it is spoken now like don't I think this anger towards the past it's not just the anger towards imperfections towards the past it's mostly anger towards that we are not we subconsciously better than our past but our whole let's say political theology is centered around it's that it was wrong and now we discovered the key how it must be done and etc etc etc so many many things are playing out I think it's not just one directional story

52
00:49:55,900 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 1: basically yeah I think that's a really interesting insight you know because in some ways there it's a it's a yeah it's a faint right it's like it's like actually a weird faint where we are actually much worse than than the ancients and we're more more stupid like you know the citizenry is less involved less educated and less aware of the issues uh and even though we're a democracy it's like we're a democracy but nobody's aware of any of the issues at least in our countries like in Canada and America we've never discussed any actual political or economic issues it's all bluster it's just insane it's all it's all just it's all just like kind of empty political rhetoric our our prime minister is astounding like Justin Trudeau is amazing like he is he is a he is a he is something to behold because he can speak for five minutes and then you you you say okay so what did he say and he realized he actually there's no content in his speech and he is the prime minister of Canada he's not dealing with any of the issues he's not giving he's just saying as Canadians we take this seriously and we're going to consider it and we know that the Canadian are with us because this is an issue that is important to us and he can do that in an entire speech and he's actually not saying anything it's it's astounding and you're right i think that's right is is that in some ways this weird contraction of the past like this weird desire to you know make the past as short as possible too this is also something that's happening is that you see that in the united states especially right like the whole slavery question in the united states is funny because people act as if the only thing that exists is that is the the kind of transatlantic state trade you know in the modern age and that everything about us is related to that but there's nothing around it like there's no history nobody knows anything about any history before before that uh that's a that's a great insight it's an interesting insight about the and it just it like contracts everything into this into this moment and then when you end up having are these really vague idea of progress

53
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,900
Speaker 0: yeah like effectively you know and progress yeah yeah

54
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:49,540
Speaker 1: and the progress thing the progress thing is a mystery to me it's it's one of the most mysterious aspects of modern politics because because progress in progress necessarily has to be teleological because you have to be able to measure progress towards a purpose but the progress that the modern politician talks about or the modern political class talks about is a vague open-ended progress that we don't know actually what it is it's like it just means something like more is it more equality more

55
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,980
Speaker 0: it's heaven on earth no i think we know what it is like again we know what it is this progress is heaven on earth right here right now yeah

56
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,520
Speaker 1: all right that's yeah that's a good that's a good probably a good it's a utopian it's a new utopian vision really

57
00:53:03,720 --> 00:54:01,640
Speaker 0: it but it's always been the case because actually like i don't know if you know about this whole hobson idea but the hobson idea we kind of keep forgetting where this idea of modern progress is coming from and one of it was actual gigantic disillusionment of europe after the 30 years old war which started our age we live in the age of modernity for like the last 400 years and it started with 30 years world uh just for the audience who might not be aware and it was devastating like and people were really like really devastated like and thinkers were really devastating it was a despair and despair was in part because the root cause of the 30 years world war 30 years you can argue world world war was that different versions of heaven been fighting each other killing each other and they decided okay so it's not so the hobs personally that was his idea okay we cannot fight about whose version of heaven is right so let's just put this question outside of the box and let's kind of then the sanctification of heaven so what is our escatological physical consciousness a system of human consciousness with the influence of god and the u.s.

58
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:17,100
Speaker 0: um the tool that is established to do that is to be a material and this is our ethical and historical time and this goal of the state is to keep the society effectively frozen until the second coming jesus will come he will solve this problem we don't have to address it but it's impossible not to address it because yeah i'm giving up my car this

59
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:24,100
Speaker 1: is this is how hub spoke i i i mean i don't know he actually had an eschatological aspect to his oh yeah no he was literally arguing against paul like he's writing his was he was directly paraphrasing paul if our paul has the church gobsmacked we don't have to be scared

60
00:54:24,560 --> 00:55:58,240
Speaker 0: he was literally Paul like he's writing his was he was directly paraphrasing Paul by Paul has the church gobs has the state he and it's literal like line by line I don't have it right in front of me but maybe in the next time or like outside we can talk about it no hopes is it's it's exactly he's deeply theological he's he's a Leviathan and you might it fascinating because you are this is a symbolism of Leviathan you are discovering right now but it's not arbitrary like it's a it's a very theological it's it's so deeply rooted in Christian tradition it's addressing Christian tradition and ultimate question he's strangling so how do we live we know that there is a second coming but we don't know when so how do we live until this when and he was because previous way of living until this when he saw around himself is like mass murder and he he did he was legitimately terrified traumatized and scared man because he was born on the day the Spanish Ramada was kind of moving towards Britain like so all these things were really deeply affected him and he was really trying and he's a solution was so let's just freeze it let's just freeze this question we let's just pretend they're not important let's just talk about different things but as we discussed before you cannot because it is the questions it is mystical any unity is a mystical unity and then you start like in 100 years theology coming taking its revenge just in its secular form in a form of French Revolution and then in a form of enlightenment it's exactly the same manner he tried he was trying to freeze but he didn't understand it's impossible to freeze but we keep pretending it's possible to freeze like that's that's an interesting

61
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:33,060
Speaker 1: yeah that's a really that's a that's a that's a definitely an interesting insight and I do think for sure you know that in some ways I mean a lot of the modern political ideas they they have definitely a kind of religious aspect or like the very idea of progress like you said in some ways it is it is a religious it's a weird religious idea and you know this vision of something this like yeah like the heavenly city or something and that it's vague enough so that it can call draw us into it but it is this yeah that's a fascinating

62
00:56:33,100 --> 00:57:16,800
Speaker 0: idea I think honestly that's actually the difference Jonathan because it's not it's simultaneously vague but the purpose is not to be drawn to it the purpose is to have it here right here right now so that's I think that's I think the true even difference with let's say the Aquinas project to bring the you know City of God to the City of Man and he at least understood it's a process and he didn't expect it to happen like immediately and it was yeah yeah a long term and now we have this paradox at the same time it's really vague as you said it's really hard to put in all of the description but we must have it right here right now it is very important to have it right here right now if it's not happening within the next presidential term we are doomed like we're doomed yeah but also because they because there's a

63
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,680
Speaker 1: they they have no clue how to get the whole

64
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,740
Speaker 0: story right now well I think it's very interesting

65
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:35,260
Speaker 1: though it's also very interesting to me that a lot of that thing is also very interesting I could say that a lot of the other things we've gone around for a long time very interesting thing that we've gone around for a long time like that it's not that many things we've done Because the globalists also use apocalyptic environmentalism, you know, to fuel the movement, you know, and it's fascinating to watch how, you know, it's interchangeable in their mind.

66
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 1: And I don't know how conscious it is where it's like, it's like there's a relationship in their mind between, let's say, racism and environmentalism, and they're able to kind of jumble it together as this like social program where we have to be a certain way.

67
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:57,260
Speaker 1: But the vision, I mean, I don't know, because I don't totally, because I'm not a progressive, right?

68
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:10,760
Speaker 1: I can kind of enter into that thinking, to some extent, and I understand some of the reactions, let's say, of the desire for variability in a system that's too set, right?

69
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:19,960
Speaker 1: And I kind of understand that, and I see it, but, you know, the vision, the vision that even they have, that's ultimate.

70
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,320
Speaker 1: seems to be anti-human.

71
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,540
Speaker 1: And that's what I don't totally, like, that's what I, I think it's satanic in that sense.

72
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,940
Speaker 1: Like, I hate to use that word too clearly.

73
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:42,920
Speaker 1: I think it's like a weird trickery, like this weird trickery that the liberation from forms of control, right, is simultaneously creating stronger and stronger forms of control at the same time.

74
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,320
Speaker 1: And that ultimately, it actually leads to a desire for the elimination of the human.

75
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:49,860
Speaker 1: Right.

76
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:55,360
Speaker 1: Which is, it's hard to wrap your head around it, but it seems to be that's what the case, the case of what we see happening.

77
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,700
Speaker 0: I can offer you a way of wrapping.

78
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, go for it.

79
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,720
Speaker 0: Sorry, like, so two points.

80
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,360
Speaker 0: The first is, it's not elimination of control.

81
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,820
Speaker 0: It's elimination of control where you, you are not the controller.

82
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:17,940
Speaker 0: So it's one of the, what unites, like, radical environmentalists and anti-racism is the hatred towards hierarchy, again.

83
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,380
Speaker 0: Yeah.

84
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:18,540
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,340
Speaker 0: And they oppose the production of hierarchy.

86
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,320
Speaker 0: And that's why they're, so that's the connecting point.

87
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,640
Speaker 0: They hate any form of hierarchy.

88
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,700
Speaker 0: And we're coming back to the point that comebacks, unfortunately, to liberal individualism.

89
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:38,680
Speaker 0: Because if you consider liberal individualism from a, from a starting point of your thought, then any form of hierarchy is imposed on them.

90
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,600
Speaker 0: It's not natural.

91
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,400
Speaker 0: It's not organic.

92
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:48,140
Speaker 0: So until you get this perfect moment that any form of subsidiarity around you is consciously chosen by you.

93
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,380
Speaker 0: In an absolute free environment with now further external influence, then you are not free.

94
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,020
Speaker 0: And they want to be this man.

95
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:01,840
Speaker 0: They want to be the man that chooses every single form of subsidiarity constantly.

96
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,880
Speaker 0: And it's not once and for all, but every single moment.

97
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,740
Speaker 0: You can argue it's, it's a little bit schizophrenic, but whatever, that's how they see it.

98
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:13,160
Speaker 0: Like, so the idea is like, because you, because there is an element of it.

99
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,840
Speaker 0: And I think Jonathan Peterson talks a little bit about it, that any name, any identity does indeed have a tyrannical element in itself.

100
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:21,260
Speaker 0: Yeah.

101
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,960
Speaker 0: The moment you accept certainty upon it, the moment you accept identity upon it, there is an element of control in it.

102
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,480
Speaker 0: There is an element, there is an element, something you must surrender to it.

103
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,380
Speaker 0: And they don't want to surrender anything.

104
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,880
Speaker 0: They want to be the one to whom it is surrendered.

105
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:36,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

106
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,060
Speaker 0: So you see how this trick it's working.

107
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,360
Speaker 1: But I don't see.

108
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,360
Speaker 1: How it's related to environmentalism.

109
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:50,080
Speaker 1: And I'll tell you, like, I'll tell you why, because, so let's take, I mean, the, the, the LGBT stuff, uh, that's clear.

110
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:58,260
Speaker 1: Like you can see that that is in some ways, you know, the ultimate liberal act, act, which is self-determination, self-naming.

111
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,800
Speaker 1: I, I'm actually not, not even dependent on any form of constraint, even in my body, even social constraint.

112
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,060
Speaker 1: Like there's no constraint.

113
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,080
Speaker 1: I, I break open the constraints and I become a rainbow.

114
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,480
Speaker 1: Right.

115
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,700
Speaker 1: Uh, it's like, it's.

116
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,700
Speaker 1: It's all multiplicity.

117
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,020
Speaker 1: Right.

118
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:24,240
Speaker 1: Um, and so that's re that that's, but then there's the, the environmental thing is a call for absolute control, but it's absolute control where we are in church and not evil capitalism.

119
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,900
Speaker 0: It's a, this is a power.

120
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,360
Speaker 0: So I told you, so the same way, it's me who controls my body.

121
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,780
Speaker 0: It should be me who controls the planet, not some hierarchical capitalist structure.

122
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,540
Speaker 0: See, so for them, it works.

123
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:38,780
Speaker 0: I know.

124
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:46,300
Speaker 0: It's a little bit tricky, but it makes sense as long as so is basically the lie is they, they claim that they want no structures, but it's a lie.

125
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:57,020
Speaker 0: They want the structure with them in control, but, uh, still the whole pattern is that in that sense, the true liberation exactly happens from, uh, any non-arbitrary hierarchy.

126
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:03,740
Speaker 0: And every arc you should be arbitrary and conscious and like chosen by me, uh, chosen by me voluntarily.

127
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:08,600
Speaker 0: So that's one important thing, but I think there is a thing deeper in it and it's connected to what we were talking before.

128
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:15,260
Speaker 0: And that's my hypothesis, but I think it comes very deep to Gnostic tradition, to many here in tradition.

129
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,180
Speaker 0: And it is a confusion of two things.

130
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if we have time to talk about it between respect and love.

131
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:32,460
Speaker 0: And I think that's actually Western thing, which could just now spread across the globe because I think especially in the West, like it's a very long story how it developed, but you as an orthodox can see it.

132
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,060
Speaker 0: Uh, there is this kind of this weird mixture that something which is not perfect.

133
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,840
Speaker 0: Or something which is not.

134
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,640
Speaker 0: Worthy of respect is also not worthy of love.

135
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:53,560
Speaker 0: There is this thing which plays again in the Western culture and it is, but as we've been talking before, because of the sinful nature, there is, there is constantly a lot of imperfection.

136
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,340
Speaker 0: There is not that much in reality in the society, which is a true worthy of respect.

137
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:58,560
Speaker 0: Okay.

138
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,780
Speaker 0: There is a king authority figure, somebody who is successful, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

139
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,280
Speaker 0: Uh, but, uh, it won't be the majority.

140
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,540
Speaker 0: America tries to solve it through like capitalism.

141
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,660
Speaker 0: And everyone was your respect, but I can straight away say no.

142
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,660
Speaker 0: Like many people will be left out.

143
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,360
Speaker 0: Many people are left out.

144
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:24,000
Speaker 0: If the only thing which is lovable is the one, it basically, if you make love and respect the same, then you have so many people left out of both.

145
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:31,060
Speaker 0: And I think that's where this whole game coming from, because then they think so, because we want to be loved, like everybody wants to be loved, et cetera, et cetera.

146
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,700
Speaker 0: Then we have to through society, through these different elements to make us worthy.

147
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,640
Speaker 0: And at the same time, they're not addressing the core issues that imperfect, uh, uh, something which is rejected.

148
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,480
Speaker 0: Like here is the whole Christ figure is coming in.

149
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:49,000
Speaker 0: He shows that love is for everyone, not for just something which is worth your own respect.

150
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:55,140
Speaker 0: You know, it says it should respect the poor, like in a sense, you know, societal that you should put them on pedestal, but he says you should love them.

151
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:02,180
Speaker 0: But because this distinction is lost, I think that's how the deep seed is coming into their thinking.

152
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,500
Speaker 0: So that's why they consider themselves just.

153
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,980
Speaker 0: That's why they consider themselves doing the good thing.

154
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:13,840
Speaker 0: That's what kind of, but it's an interesting hypothesis.

155
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,980
Speaker 1: I'm kind of testing it out in my mind on different things.

156
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:27,000
Speaker 1: Uh, because, so this is my, my, the way that I tend to approach it is really through the idea that extremes necessarily call each other.

157
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,920
Speaker 1: That's the way that I tend to think about it.

158
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:35,040
Speaker 1: And so that's why when I see a move towards idiosyncrasy, what I notice is that there's a move towards control.

159
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,260
Speaker 1: There's a move towards control.

160
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,860
Speaker 1: That happens simultaneously.

161
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,520
Speaker 1: And that move towards control becomes more and more tyrannical as the move towards idiosyncrasy functions.

162
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,780
Speaker 1: And so, and so to me, that's the only way to explain certain things.

163
01:04:47,820 --> 01:05:03,260
Speaker 1: So for example, like the relationship between self naming and you being whatever it is that you want to be, and you could just say what you are, you're a cat, you're a whatever, and that you can become whatever you want that and cancel culture.

164
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,400
Speaker 1: At the outset, you think, how do those things fit together?

165
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:16,560
Speaker 1: But it's because one necessitates, necessitates the other by its very, by its very idiosyncratic emphasis.

166
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:16,900
Speaker 1: Right.

167
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:24,740
Speaker 1: And so that to me is the way that I explained also the relationship between globalist control tendencies.

168
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,060
Speaker 1: Like that's why there was even, it was so weird that it was so weird in COVID to watch the alignments.

169
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:30,680
Speaker 1: Right.

170
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,180
Speaker 1: To watch the, the, the, the rainbow people align with.

171
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,960
Speaker 1: Align with absolute state control over every aspect of your life.

172
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,060
Speaker 1: And, and it was like, how is it, how did this work?

173
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,340
Speaker 1: But I, I realized that in some ways that this was a necessary thing.

174
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,440
Speaker 0: Sorry, just a quick.

175
01:05:48,600 --> 01:06:00,060
Speaker 1: Because, because let me just one say, we'll say one more thing is that the, so the, what happens is that on the one hand, and even in this rainbow culture, you have something like, you know, you should love me just the way I am.

176
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,060
Speaker 1: Right.

177
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,760
Speaker 1: You should love.

178
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,720
Speaker 1: You, you should not judge me.

179
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,400
Speaker 1: You should love me.

180
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:21,800
Speaker 1: But then in it, there's this insane level of judgment that will basically, you know, force you to do like, you know, that, that, that can, that can destroy your career, destroy your life, destroy all of your, all of your reputation.

181
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,680
Speaker 0: Because it's not love.

182
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,680
Speaker 0: Because again, again, there is a trick I think.

183
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,360
Speaker 0: All right, go for it.

184
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:25,980
Speaker 0: Which is happening.

185
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,640
Speaker 0: Because it's not about love.

186
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,540
Speaker 0: It's about chosen.

187
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,360
Speaker 0: And it's unfortunately this derivative of American Protestantism.

188
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,660
Speaker 0: Because again, I think I was wrong.

189
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,000
Speaker 0: That is the only chosen can be loved.

190
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,700
Speaker 0: Only pure can be loved.

191
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,220
Speaker 0: Only perfect can be loved.

192
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,140
Speaker 0: And like chosen who is saved, you know, the whole.

193
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:42,260
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:42,380
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,480
Speaker 0: Like the.

196
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,320
Speaker 0: Select.

197
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:45,420
Speaker 0: Elect.

198
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,820
Speaker 0: So what's the name love?

199
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,980
Speaker 0: It's like, you should love me.

200
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,300
Speaker 0: The name.

201
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,700
Speaker 0: No, I should be elect.

202
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,700
Speaker 0: I am the elect.

203
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,000
Speaker 0: And it's all competition of different for different statuses of elect.

204
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,400
Speaker 0: So I cannot be elect in capitalist system.

205
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,240
Speaker 0: And I think it's wrong.

206
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,140
Speaker 0: I don't think your quote unquote electability should be based on a very economic success.

207
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,180
Speaker 0: It's a different story.

208
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,880
Speaker 0: But that's why I think they kind of created this.

209
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,320
Speaker 0: But then they so we cannot compete this.

210
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,420
Speaker 0: So we create an alternative way of competition.

211
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,820
Speaker 0: But for the same thing.

212
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,020
Speaker 0: So now we're elect because we are rainbow.

213
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,520
Speaker 0: Now we're elect because we are wearing a mask.

214
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,700
Speaker 0: And the goal of the state is to effectively give you a passport paper.

215
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:20,840
Speaker 0: You are the elect one.

216
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,480
Speaker 0: That's what they're fighting for.

217
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:23,600
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

218
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,760
Speaker 1: That's an interesting idea.

219
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,940
Speaker 1: And so then the social credit system tendency that we were moving towards makes sense.

220
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,540
Speaker 1: It's like you.

221
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,200
Speaker 1: You're basically want God to tell you you're of the chosen people.

222
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,660
Speaker 1: But because we don't believe in God, we want the state to do it.

223
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,080
Speaker 1: To say you're a good boy.

224
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,720
Speaker 1: You know, like you're the one.

225
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,120
Speaker 1: And now people should love you.

226
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,780
Speaker 0: And now people.

227
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,120
Speaker 0: Exactly.

228
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:46,860
Speaker 0: You're the good one.

229
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,160
Speaker 0: And now people should love you.

230
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:48,500
Speaker 0: Yes.

231
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:48,680
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:48,860
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:49,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:49,840
Speaker 1: That's it.

236
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,180
Speaker 1: Really.

237
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,580
Speaker 1: That's an interesting idea.

238
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,820
Speaker 1: Because because usually the way that that functions.

239
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,100
Speaker 1: Right.

240
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,780
Speaker 1: Is is organic.

241
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,160
Speaker 1: And that's where you get the kind of respect and love and a kind of election.

242
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:02,380
Speaker 1: Right.

243
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:09,420
Speaker 1: Because if I marry someone, I, I elect them if I you know if I if I hire people, I elect them.

244
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,740
Speaker 1: And so there's this there's this kind of organic process.

245
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,780
Speaker 1: But you know the yeah.

246
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:22,740
Speaker 1: The tendency is to want to find a way to be a an elect that shortcuts all of that.

247
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,340
Speaker 0: And like the state short cut because because it's all tyrannical and bad because they are not arbitrary.

248
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,439
Speaker 0: I'm not free in this, because I was born into family.

249
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:34,180
Speaker 0: For example, I'm not loved by my family, and I was born into it.

250
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:50,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so the, you know, strange, whatever, brave new world vision that you see in some of those cultures, where you should not be allowed to refuse to sleep with someone.

251
01:08:50,720 --> 01:09:01,960
Speaker 1: Like, you see that in some of the rainbow stuff, where it's like, you know, I'm a trans this, and it's like, it's unacceptable that you don't want to sleep with me.

252
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:09,140
Speaker 1: Like, you should, and it's like, there's this weird implying that almost like the state should force you to sleep.

253
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,500
Speaker 0: Because otherwise, you're denying me my chosen status.

254
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:16,300
Speaker 1: Exactly, you're denying my identity by not, by not, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,460
Speaker 1: That's an interesting idea.

256
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,140
Speaker 1: I'd have to play that out in my mind.

257
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,760
Speaker 1: Also, like, to see what the corollaries are.

258
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:26,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, to see what, so, so this is interesting.

259
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,000
Speaker 1: Also, in the.

260
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,700
Speaker 1: The idea, you know, you see that in, in the book of Revelation, you see these two images, right?

261
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,399
Speaker 1: One is the image of the number of the beast, right?

262
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,540
Speaker 1: So, the beast gives you a number, gives you a name, right?

263
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Speaker 1: And for all intents and purposes, and that makes you part of the system.

264
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,040
Speaker 1: And now, without that, you cannot be recognized.

265
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,620
Speaker 1: Like, nobody can recognize you unless you have that name.

266
01:09:50,319 --> 01:10:00,900
Speaker 1: But then there's another image in the same book, which is that God places on you a secret name, like a name that is only your name, and that that is your true elect nature.

267
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,020
Speaker 1: Like, in the sense that you are made in the image of God.

268
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,880
Speaker 0: True name, effectively, you're a true name.

269
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,100
Speaker 1: You're a true name, right?

270
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,540
Speaker 1: And so, it's like these two images of where it is that we get our value from.

271
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:13,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:19,900
Speaker 0: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the difference is that, like, the mark of the beast is visible, and the mark of the God is invisible.

273
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:20,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hidden.

274
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,620
Speaker 1: It's a hidden.

275
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,620
Speaker 1: It says, there are different images of it.

276
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,460
Speaker 1: We'll give a, we'll put your name on a stone.

277
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:25,700
Speaker 1: Like, what?

278
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,660
Speaker 1: A white stone that only you will know, like, there's a secret aspect to it, for sure.

279
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,440
Speaker 0: But see, that's the thing, that's where it's, for us, everyone is a human.

280
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,900
Speaker 0: I think that's the challenge, because this hidden element, there is no certainty.

281
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,580
Speaker 0: Like, you don't know.

282
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:43,760
Speaker 0: And that's like what the Christian culture has been struggling for, like, millennia.

283
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:49,420
Speaker 0: We have to admit that people wanted to be saved, but they, it was, but they were anxious about it.

284
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,500
Speaker 0: They, because you don't know, are you saved or you're not.

285
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,240
Speaker 0: It's, if it's the most important question, if it is hidden.

286
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,560
Speaker 0: So, it's a constant.

287
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,200
Speaker 0: Exercise in this humility.

288
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,080
Speaker 0: It's a constant exercise of surrendering yourself and you can humanly understand the desire.

289
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,440
Speaker 0: I just want a paper.

290
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,120
Speaker 0: I just want somebody to tell me for sure, being at God or state.

291
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,840
Speaker 1: I don't just give me my ticket.

292
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:17,740
Speaker 0: Give me in actually in both ways, either I mean, or I out, but don't torture me with this uncertainty.

293
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,100
Speaker 0: I think that's one of the, I think like it's something psychological here involves it.

294
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,820
Speaker 1: We can't really, but that's interesting.

295
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,800
Speaker 1: I'd never like.

296
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,140
Speaker 1: I would never have put a Calvinist twist on this, but it is something to think about for sure.

297
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:38,040
Speaker 1: It's something to consider in terms of this idea of, of a kind of certain T of election in you.

298
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:39,000
Speaker 1: Right.

299
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,900
Speaker 1: Which is that, you know, the traditional way of understanding the certainty of election is that the certainty of election is in Christ.

300
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,520
Speaker 1: It's not in you.

301
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,080
Speaker 0: Like it's exactly, no, exactly.

302
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:55,560
Speaker 1: Cause that's a, yeah, but, but, but bringing it into the individualism, like linking it to individualism brings that weird kind of state.

303
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,280
Speaker 1: Um, yeah.

304
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:06,240
Speaker 1: And then wanting to be, to be chosen by something that makes it public that you are to be loved.

305
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,740
Speaker 0: Let's say, and then we just have competition on.

306
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,420
Speaker 0: They criteria on which criteria we are giving this paper.

307
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:12,960
Speaker 0: Is it money?

308
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,300
Speaker 0: Is it a race?

309
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:14,980
Speaker 0: Is it nation?

310
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,960
Speaker 0: Is it classes?

311
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,080
Speaker 0: It's a gender?

312
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,760
Speaker 0: It's just a competition, which grade on which criteria we're giving the paper?

313
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,800
Speaker 0: Like, then the whole just develops them to it.

314
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,500
Speaker 0: And that's how.

315
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:40,560
Speaker 0: But so what unites all of these different people who kind of hate each other often is precisely the principle, which we kind of this whole idea of chosenness, not through Christ, which I think actually is a great way of saying it, which you mentioned.

316
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:41,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,560
Speaker 1: That's I mean, it's definitely insightful.

318
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,120
Speaker 1: My mind is going a mile a minute.

319
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:53,100
Speaker 1: So I would definitely have to think about some of the things we're talking about to see how they kind of how they jive with other things that I've been thinking about.

320
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:59,080
Speaker 1: But it's an interesting, definitely an interesting, an interesting way of thinking about the problem that we're dealing with now.

321
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, for sure.

322
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:21,760
Speaker 0: Just again, so I guess we can talk more about it next time, hopefully, like, so if you don't mind, I just wanted to say how it is bring it back to the whole political idea, because I think there is this whole element also about this chosenness and surrendering yourself to Christ or not in a way that and here people might argue.

323
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Speaker 0: But, you know, that in.

324
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:51,540
Speaker 0: Maximus, the confessor, he speaks that all of the logos were effectively created before time and effectively that all of the identities you can argue as a as a similar pattern are pre-created, like all true identities are pre-created and another challenge for modern and rationalist enlightenment thinking, which goes into all these different patterns we describe is to accept it because we understand identity is something we create is something we choose.

325
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,220
Speaker 0: And to surrender.

326
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:57,160
Speaker 0: To surrender to something, it's something we should we should receive and not control.

327
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:04,580
Speaker 0: That's a big ultimate challenge, but it's also the core challenge, which also kind of unites all of these different elements together.

328
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,480
Speaker 0: That's that would be my last, I guess, point.

329
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,560
Speaker 1: And yeah, I think, I mean, that definitely makes sense.

330
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:19,420
Speaker 1: And in some ways, that is the the one of the aspects of subsidiarity and the idea of how identity is received.

331
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:19,760
Speaker 1: Right.

332
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,840
Speaker 1: It comes from heaven.

333
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,080
Speaker 1: It's hard for modernists to hear language.

334
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,500
Speaker 1: Like that.

335
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:32,120
Speaker 1: But there's a manner in which identity is the precondition for the being to come together towards a purpose.

336
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:32,340
Speaker 1: Right.

337
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:51,940
Speaker 1: So you could say that an identity is a purpose calling multiplicity into its unity and that and that this, like you said, is is received and all the sins of the the big sins in the Bible, whether it's the sin of Adam and Eve, whether it's the sin of Satan, even if the sin of St.

338
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:52,320
Speaker 1: Peter.

339
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,260
Speaker 1: Is a sin of self-naming, self-identifying.

340
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:56,480
Speaker 1: Right.

341
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:56,640
Speaker 1: And St.

342
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:09,660
Speaker 1: Maximus, the confessor, he identifies that himself as what he called the sins of the right hand, which is this idea that it's the first sin is always a sin of of not receiving from God.

343
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:09,880
Speaker 1: Right.

344
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,240
Speaker 1: Of saying of trying to contain an identity fully in itself and to own it or at its level.

345
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,900
Speaker 1: And that then leads to breakdown.

346
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,020
Speaker 1: Right.

347
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,180
Speaker 1: It's an image of the Tower of Babel.

348
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:19,260
Speaker 1: St.

349
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,180
Speaker 1: Maximus obviously thinks like things and all these things together.

350
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:28,540
Speaker 1: Like if you try to hold on to something and make it real completely on its own, then it shatters.

351
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,760
Speaker 0: But just how it works in the political, we just should have started with that.

352
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:34,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, go for it.

353
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:51,740
Speaker 0: Basically, I was arguing in a simple example idea that we think that we can take any group of people and make them a state just because we recognize this as such, for example, or make it a nation just because we recognize without any all the different subsidiarity relations that it was very evidently, you know, after the so-called decolonization.

354
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:51,860
Speaker 0: Right.

355
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:51,980
Speaker 0: Right.

356
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:52,100
Speaker 0: Right.

357
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:52,220
Speaker 0: Right.

358
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:52,340
Speaker 0: Right.

359
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:52,460
Speaker 0: Right.

360
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:52,580
Speaker 0: Right.

361
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:52,720
Speaker 0: Right.

362
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:52,880
Speaker 0: Right.

363
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,060
Speaker 0: Right.

364
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,820
Speaker 0: So then we've kind of you kind of go back into the denaturalization process when Western Empires were just leaving.

365
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,360
Speaker 0: And this is a borders that we created.

366
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,000
Speaker 0: So just you take them and live in them without living in.

367
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,200
Speaker 0: Understandings that they're not corresponding to anything.

368
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,440
Speaker 0: But that's exactly the same pattern.

369
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,900
Speaker 0: So we just come and make whatever we want, including states.

370
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:08,960
Speaker 0: And it doesn't.

371
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:09,980
Speaker 0: They must grow.

372
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,960
Speaker 0: And yeah, part of organic growth is competition fighting.

373
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,260
Speaker 0: Yes, it it can get bloody, but there is a pattern.

374
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,500
Speaker 0: But back to your point, exactly as massive comparison.

375
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,380
Speaker 0: So like for us, it's just hard to accept that.

376
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:22,500
Speaker 0: Uh.

377
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:39,360
Speaker 0: identities on all level being on personal family structural political global which goes on a global level it's exactly as you said the same pattern we can create this name and identity for ourselves not receive it but we yeah great

378
01:16:39,880 --> 01:17:36,860
Speaker 1: no that's exactly that i think that you're i think that that intuition is is right and in some ways you know that is you know and there's a type of humility right which is that you know when you're born in a family right you don't choose your family you you don't and your family comes with all the sins and all the virtues of that family and i think it's the same with with our participation in different peoples like you know i'm a french canadian right and so i don't choose that i'm i'm born into that reality if i try to deny it for some universalist thing uh and i try or i tried to self-create my identity then i'm actually i'm denying you know aspects of what of what i am and it's not useful it's better to acknowledge the virtues and the sins and to try to cover the sins of my father right to cover the the nakedness of my father as i move forward um yeah

379
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:46,900
Speaker 0: well yeah i couldn't agree with agree more with what you just said and i guess for the rest of the questions we raised we can talk next time when you have sure

380
01:17:48,140 --> 01:18:44,600
Speaker 1: yeah but i think like the difficulty that we have now is in some ways because we're facing these global solutions like we're noticing the global solutions kind of establish themselves and we're actually seeing them as you know competing or trying to compete with national national interest uh you know the question is what can we do because it can really bring us into a state of despair because we we we're presented with the vision of an individual in this global citizenship right but i do think that the solution the solution that we can do is recreate subsidiarity at the local level right and that is to be a father to be in a family to be a member of a community whether it's a church whether it's you know different different aspects and that that that building of subsidiarity will offer resilience when taro the taro babel falls

381
01:18:45,040 --> 01:20:09,760
Speaker 0: i yes we we can develop this so basically i completely agree with you that's exactly the same advice i give when people ask me okay so it's all well and good but what we do well some basically i have to admit i'm borrowing this isos of yours because i agree with it i would just add one step which in my opinion is necessary for it exactly in the on a level of a soul you need to recreate subsidiarity between you and something higher than you because it is in my opinion the foundation for all of the other subsidiaries which you've been describing but it's just a nitpicking from my side and other than that effectively you just said it's just i would say it's a paraphrase what we have in the 36 psalm which says fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be though envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and with as the green herb trust in the lord and do good so shall though dwelt in the land and verily thou shall be fed so kind of it again we are not the first one who dealing with it i think that's constantly missing this element we are not yes technology makes it seems that we are in a more dangerous situation because let's say the scale is bigger but the pattern is the same and the towers of babel have already fallen multiple times like yeah like it it's not the first time it's happening so like so that's a practical advice actually yeah read history and then you don't feel so lonely so then you don't like you said

382
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:31,160
Speaker 1: i think the the psalm is quoted is great and you're you're it's like love god and love your neighbor that's it like if you do that then that that's the only solution it's the one that christ gave us it's it's and that's the solution to to the subsidiarity problem because if you do that then they'll have natural relationships with things around you you know and you won't be to

383
01:20:31,240 --> 01:21:52,860
Speaker 0: what extent and works yeah maybe in a better times it will be bigger circle of relationship maybe in the worst time when everything starts falling apart it will be the circle of your city the circle is a circle of your neighborhood but it's like not for us to know that like you know there was recently is a um ascensions and like it's not for you to know the time and it's not for you to know the times we are told so it's not for us to know the times but it's for us to do what we can and but to understand it i think you do need to and that's your favorite subject which i agree with completely you need to know the stories i would argue that without stories without research like people you cannot really orient yourself in this maze because yeah we've been talking for it forever in the hub and it's just the beginning of this maze like we like our thing is is so trapped in these different loopholes which are seems self-evident but we don't understand why self-evident we don't understand what is unifying them so it takes time but doesn't that you can keep the optimist going and the best way is the story says i think it's just in the end want to mention that the story can kind of summarize our or even better what you do is image an image can summarize the hour and a half political theology conversation into one image and you can look upon it and see it in everything and that's also a good place to start

384
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,460
Speaker 1: yeah yeah that's great

385
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:10,660
